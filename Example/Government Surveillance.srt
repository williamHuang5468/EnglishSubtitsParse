3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,170
my story tonight is government
surveillance and

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,269
I realize most people would rather have
a conversation about literally

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,750
any all the topic including is my small
on giving me cancer to which the answer

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,890
is probably

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,289
all do goldfish suffer from depression
to which the answer is

8
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,750
yes but very briefly but the fact it's

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,740
it is vital but we have a discussion
about this now because an important date

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,890
is just around the corner one big data
service circle on the calendar when it

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,370
comes to a very controversial subject
the reauthorization of the Patriot Act

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:36,730
and

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,320
all of the controversial provisions
there in June 1st they've gotta come to

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,790
an agreement to reauthorize

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,829
or curtailed his program yes some
controversial provisions within the

16
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:46,520
Patriot Act

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,500
a pager tact all set to expire on June
the first so circle that tight

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,899
on your calendars everyone and while
you're at it circle June 2nd as well

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,870
because thats Justin Long's birthday you
all forgot last year any

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,539
he noticed cow over the last couple
years

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,409
you probably heard a lot about strange
sounding programs such as

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,670
X ke school muscular prism and mystic

23
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,349
which %ah coincidently also the nines
have some %uh florida's least popular

24
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,259
strip clubs

25
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:20,530
welcome to XK school all told his a
fully on rejected and shoes by his

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,599
warning lights

27
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,739
but but if you don't mind I would like
to refresh you memory over some things

28
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:30,319
and let's stop by focusing on the most
controversial portion of the Patriot Act

29
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,319
that is up from renewal section 215
which on the way

30
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,830
sounds like the name all Eastern
European boy backed

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,310
we all section 215 prepared to have your
hearts

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,280
slobodan in her says the

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,580
at the camp along with the bad boy water
struggle but I saw Obama and the one

34
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,700
without annoying deficiency their
incredible

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,110
but the contents all the real section
215

36
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,660
actually even more sinister top section
215 nicknamed

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,370
the library records provision which
allows the government to require

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,000
businesses to hand over records have any
quote any

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,509
tangible things including books records
papers documents

40
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:15,020
and other items that sounds brought it's
because

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,699
it was pretty much written that white
section 215 said the government can ask

42
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:18,940
for

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,709
any tangible things so long so long as
its for an investigation to protect

44
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,860
against international terrorism which is
basically a blank check

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,060
assaulting a teenager borrow the car on
the street condition

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,190
but I only use it for car related
activities

47
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,280
okay mama dot I'm going to use this for
a hand job

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,930
in the Wendy's parking lot but that is
car lighting so I think I'm public's

49
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,880
section 215 is overseen by a secret
intelligence course known as the fully

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,440
support

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,780
and they've interpreted it to mean the
government could basically collect

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,319
install phone records for every American
the vast majority of whom of course

53
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,039
have no connection to terrorism unless
on cheryl has been greatly miss

54
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,019
characterizing activities a needlepoint
Klopp

55
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,560
it's a sleeper cell evening on Cheryl he
will happen for this on Shoal

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,650
you're trying to I'm a terrible alt not
in that order

57
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,699
now the government will point out that
on the 215 by hold

58
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:19,158
phone records and not the calls
themselves

59
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,370
what the

60
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,378
intelligence community is doing is

61
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,430
looking at phone numbers

62
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,098
and rations have calls they are not
looking at

63
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:37,509
people's names and they're not looking
at content yes

64
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,000
but that's not entirely reassuring you
can extrapolate

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,430
a lot from that information 8 if I can
you you called your X

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,239
12 times last night between one and 4i
at for a duration a fifteen minutes each

67
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,759
time

68
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,568
I can be fairly sure that you left some
pretty pathetic for smiles

69
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,688
Don't Tell law during this call Vicki we
should play together

70
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:02,180
pick up the phone to cuba got a ball

71
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,068
no the Patriot Act was written just
after the 9/11

72
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,750
and for years it was extended and
reauthorized with barely a possum

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,348
thought

74
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:15,818
in fact became sole routine the winnings
extended in 2011

75
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:20,940
one newscast just tacked on to the end
report about a presidential trip abroad

76
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,069
chip Reid CBS News traveling with the
president in Deauville France

77
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,709
also in France by the way President
Obama signed into law a four-year

78
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,630
extension of the terrorism playing
Patriot Act

79
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,870
also in france boy at the white

80
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,230
hogging the limelight he threw that in
like a mother telling her grown daughter

81
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,389
than a childhood pet just died

82
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,360
ok much talking to you sweetie also by
the way mister purpose is dead see you

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,449
at Christmas by

84
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,290
put all attacks was before the public
was made aware of what the government's

85
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,149
capabilities

86
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,779
actually were is that all ended in June
2013

87
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,560
Edwards noted it's just taking
responsibility for one of the biggest

88
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,470
government leaks

89
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,569
in US history we learn that the
government has the capacity track

90
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,449
virtually every American phone call

91
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,430
and a scoop up impossibly bass
quantities of data across the internet

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,880
revelations that the NSA eavesdropped on
world leaders

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,478
if you've ever been to the Bahamas the
NSA could have recorded your phone calls

94
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,569
and store them for up to a month

95
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,699
yet all that information was exposed by
Edward snowden

96
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,889
and it is still kinda incredible the
29-year-old contract that was able to

97
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,639
steal top secret documents

98
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,199
from an organization literally has the
word security

99
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,699
in its nine clearly that was not great
for them

100
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,500
because the only place where should be
that easy for employees may 22 steel

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,389
israel needs store told the short shirts
like this

102
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,310
relax dude it's a Miami Marlins cap
we're not exactly selling Faberge eggs

103
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,199
here

104
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,240
in it is still unclear

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,350
exactly how many documents and what's
not install

106
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,630
although he is consistently tried to
reassure people that he put them in good

107
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,410
hands

108
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,370
honestly I'm dole wont to be the person
making decisions on what should be

109
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,459
public watchin

110
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:07,959
which is why rather than publishing
these on my own

111
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,250
are more putting openly I'm running
through journalists

112
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,990
and that sounds great but of course it's
not a final site plan

113
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,029
as was proven when the New York Times
published this law and

114
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:22,899
but it's such a sloppy job locking out
with ducted information that some people

115
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,779
able to reach the information behind
that black ball

116
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,009
which concerned how the US was
monitoring al Qaeda emotional

117
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,300
a group now known as I sis so
essentially

118
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,930
a national security threat was leaked
because no one in the times knows how

119
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,519
teams

120
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,079
Microsoft Paint and look

121
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,120
you can think that's not only did the
wrong thing

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,649
all did it in the wrong way but the fact
is we have this information now

123
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,790
and we no longer get the luxury pleading
ignorance it's like you call go to

124
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,630
SeaWorld

125
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,449
a pretend the shallows happy anymore
when we now know

126
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,519
at least of the water in her tank is
while tears

127
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,050
we know that now you called all know
that information

128
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,620
so you have to bear that in mind but
here's the thing:

129
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,730
it's now two years later and it seems
like we've kind of gotten to have a tick

130
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,139
bite

131
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,620
over the content what's known linked
recent Pew report found that nearly Hall

132
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,168
Americans site and not very concerned or
not at all concerned

133
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:25,319
about government surveillance which is
fine if that's an informed opinion but

134
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm not sure all

135
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,829
that it is because we actually sent a
camera crew to time square

136
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,620
to ask some random passersby who Edward
snowden walls

137
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,829
and what he did and these are the
responses that we got I have no idea who

138
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,800
averaged known as

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,810
and now I have no idea where we're
snowed in this I've heard the name

140
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,519
I just can't picture think right now
exactly what it is

141
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,180
Edward snowed in no I do not

142
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,440
just for the record that wasn't
cherry-picking that was entirely

143
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,459
reflective everyone we spoke to

144
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,478
although to be fair some people didn't
remember his nine

145
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,690
I just couldn't remember why he sold
some information to people

146
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,500
here be open information

147
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,860
that

148
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,160
shouldn't have been revealed think from
what I remember is the information that

149
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,399
he shared was detrimental to our
military secrets

150
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,440
and keeping our soldiers in our country
safe begin leaked documents

151
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
but the US army's operations in Iraq
average no

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,610
revealed Ubuntu secret I guess ur
information in the wiki

153
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,199
WikiLeaks worse now than we he's inside
a weekly

154
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,710
edwards known revealed a lot of
documents to Wikileak ok so here's the

155
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,028
thing

156
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:39,799
and what's known is not the wiki leaks
got WikiLeaks guy

157
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,799
is Julian assaults I'm you do not want
to be confused with him

158
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,309
partly because he was falling
scaffolding snowden in what he released

159
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:51,309
and how and partly because he was it was
a sandwich bag for the biscuit tall

160
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,860
wearing a speedy next week

161
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,259
the I'm got his got his practical

162
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,169
Suva songs is not a likable man even
Benedict Cumberbatch

163
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:05,049
could not make him likable he's own
comeback schiphol

164
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,470
call was supposed to be physically
impossible

165
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,820
but I don't blame people for being
confused

166
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,029
we've been looking at the story for the
last two weeks i think is hard to get

167
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,089
your head around

168
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,830
not just because there are so many
complicated programs to keep track of

169
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,769
but also because

170
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,389
there are no easy answers here week all
naturally

171
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,549
want perfect privacy and perfect safety
but those two things

172
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,620
cannot coexist it's like how you can't
have

173
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,720
a bad aspect Falcon and an adorable pet
vol.9 herbert's

174
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,419
a

175
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,350
a do you have to lose one of them which
obviously you don't want to do

176
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,789
we have to accept some reasonable
restrictions on both of them

177
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:52,210
now to be fair the NS I will argue that
just because I can do something

178
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,690
doesn't mean they do to it and that they
all restrictions

179
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,130
on the operations such as the political
which must

180
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,600
approve requests phone surveillance pops
in 34 years

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,399
that course is approved over 35,000
applications

182
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,799
and only rejected 12th yes much like
Robert Durst second wife

183
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,990
the phones the court is all longingly
except

184
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,870
in Miserables a look at a los Q too many
questions I'm just gonna give you the

185
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,839
benefit of the doubt that you clearly
don't deserve

186
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,549
at least tell him to blink and book less

187
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:34,350
those the public might be the most
troubling thing about that shop so

188
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,799
so maybe it is time for us to talk

189
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,460
about where the limits should be and the
best place to start

190
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,980
would be section 215 not just because
it's the easiest to understand

191
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,570
because there is widespread agreement it
needs to be reformed

192
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,190
from the president to Ted Cruz to both
the ACLU

193
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,299
and the and alrighty to even the guy who
wrote the thing in the first place

194
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,799
I was the principal author the Patriot
Act I can say that without

195
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,019
qualification congress never did

196
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,409
in 10 do allowable collections when it
passed section 250

197
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,830
and no fair reading up to text would
allow for this program

198
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,320
think about that he was the author
that's the legislative equivalent

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,769
Lewis Carroll saying the teacups ride at
Disneyland in sight

200
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,970
this has to be writing day in no fair
reading a book text would allow for this

201
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,230
right

202
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,440
you touch my publicly night I love
psychedelic pedofilia

203
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,580
it what a race for Victoria this is not
what I want it

204
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,690
and even the n/a site

205
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,970
has said that the number of terror plots
in the US that the section 215 telephone

206
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,679
records programs is disrupted

207
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,909
is Wong and it's worth noting that one
particular plot

208
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,070
involved a cab driver in San Diego who
gave eighty five hundred dollars

209
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,059
to a terror group and that is the
shittiest terrorist plot on ever seen

210
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,100
all that and the plot have a good day to
die hard

211
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,870
but he here's the big problem here if we
let section 215 get when you can its

212
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,799
current form

213
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,919
without series public to bite we're in
trouble because section 215 is the

214
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,070
canary in the coalmine

215
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,490
if we cannot fix that we're not gonna
fix any of them

216
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,860
and the public to fight two bites of all
has been absolutely pathetic

217
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,860
a year ago a former congresswoman was
discussing the 215 program on the news

218
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,470
watch what happened this vast collection
of data

219
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,600
is a not that useful and infringes

220
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,750
substantially on personal privacy i
think at this point we should

221
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,850
seriously consider II not shiite not
concomitant

222
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,769
teenage an issue comes amid let me
interrupt you just for a moment we've

223
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:47,710
got some breaking news

224
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:54,000
at Miami standby coming out right now in
Miami justin Bieber has been arrested

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,860
charges pecans drina charges

226
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,059
including resisting arrest and driving
under the influence is appearing now

227
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:03,470
before the judge for his bond hearing
that's what

228
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,570
the

229
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,269
all all actually you know or 5 news
we're gonna have to interrupt your

230
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:14,059
interruption all the big news for a new
interruption

231
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,970
this time featuring a YouTube video of a
tortoise having sex with a plastic clog

232
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,870
let's watch

233
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:25,429
the the

234
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:35,389
that's is essentially the current song
on this vitally important to but

235
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,409
her

236
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:42,269
and again all not saying this isn't easy
conversation

237
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,399
but we have to have it I know this is
confusing

238
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,679
unfortunately the most obvious person to
talk to about these

239
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,320
is Edward snowed in but he currently
lives in Russia meeting

240
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,839
if you wanted to asking about any these
issues you have to fly all the way back

241
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,600
to do it

242
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,049
and it is not a pleasant flight and the
reason I know thats

243
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,080
is the last week I went to Russia

244
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,539
to speak to ed wood snowed in and this
is what hap the yes last week I expect

245
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,110
48 paranoid Howard in moscow

246
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,389
arguably the last place on earth where
you can find in like joseph stalin

247
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,250
impersonator

248
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,059
arguing with them unconvincing fight
planning after experiencing russia's

249
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,929
famously warm hospitality want to meet
Edward snowed

250
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,740
who's supposed to show up in this room
at moon however at five minutes off to

251
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,620
the interview was scheduled to begin

252
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,289
I have a troubling thoughts on up

253
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:44,059
these comment cuz my argument is

254
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:51,080
why woody when you think about it got
two thousand rubles

255
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:58,480
the says he doesn't make it without
understanding how much that is

256
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,419
all I'm saying is

257
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:04,480
10 of light for an empty chair

258
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,669
I'm gonna lose my shit the it turns out
that many people have a problem because

259
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,009
all Russian producer

260
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:17,470
book to see the room directly
overlooking

261
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,708
the old KGB building

262
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,759
and the home the comment Federal
Security Bureau

263
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,990
we've just been told they know we're
here

264
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,480

265
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,309
um

266
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:43,570
too steep for if the Russian Russian KGB
is listed with the fire alarm if he's

267
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,429
not coming

268
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:50,590
shit

269
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:57,938

quandary d calf guess nightmare him

292
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,349
urine okay let's talk why

293
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,890
did you do this the NSA has the

294
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,609
greatest surveillance capabilities the
that we've ever seen

295
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,490
history now what they will argue is that
they don't

296
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,089
a use this for nefarious purposes

297
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:46,980
against American citizens in some ways

298
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,390
that's true but the real problem is that

299
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,619
they're using these capabilities to make
us vulnerable to them

300
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:58,470
and then saying well I had a gun pointed
at your head

301
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,109
I'm not gonna pull the trigger trust me
so

302
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:05,690
was the NSA you want look like because
you apply eat

303
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,880
for a job with the n/a site were you
clearly see an inherent value

304
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,089
in that shadowy organization I worked
with mass surveillance systems

305
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:20,509
against chinese hackers I saw that you
know these things do have some purpose

306
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,779
and you want your spice to be good at
spying

307
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:27,119
to be fair right what you don't want is
you don't want them

308
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,480
spying inside their own country spies

309
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,990
are great when they're on our side but
we can never forget that they're

310
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,180
incredibly powerful incredibly dangerous

311
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,670
and if they're off the leash taken in
the coming after us

312
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,430
but just because we're too at two
different things here domestic

313
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,930
surveillance on foreign soil

314
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,200
good domestic surveillance americans
give some other shit about

315
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,309
phone surveillance they don't give any

316
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,869
remote shit about well the second
question is when we talk about foreign

317
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:55,710
surveillance

318
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,950
are or we applying it in ways that are
beneficial

319
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,028
no one cares in terms that no I don't
give a shit

320
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:05,608
we spied on unicef the Children's Fund
shore

321
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:09,499
whose on lawyers negotiating

322
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:14,419
I holes unicef doing I mean that's the
question as in

323
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,839
the questions are these programs
valuable

324
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,969
are we going to be safer when were
spying on unicef

325
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:26,279
and lawyers were talking about the price
shrimp and cloak cigarettes I don't

326
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,368
think people say that's good I think
I'll say

327
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:32,298
I definitely don't care Americans do not
give a shit

328
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:37,190
I think you're right about phones like
what some people do care about is

329
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,858
whether snowden conceded the

330
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:42,898
adverse consequences up leaking so much
information at once

331
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:46,648
how many of those documents have you
actually read

332
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:49,969
I've evaluated all the documents there
in the archive

333
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:53,348
you read every single one well I do
understand

334
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:57,118
turned over pollute the difference
between understanding

335
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:00,460
what in the document and reading what's
in the documents

336
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,608
I'm recognize the concern rocking a good
one when handing over thousands of an SI

337
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,579
documents the last thing you want to do
is

338
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:10,888
read them I think it's fair

339
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:14,548
to be concerned about did this person do
enough where they careful enough

340
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,808
is working when you're handling material
like we know you're handling

341
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:22,469
well in my defense I'm not handling
anything anymore that's been passed to

342
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:23,679
the journalists and their

343
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,229
using extraordinary security measures to
make sure that this is reported in the

344
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:28,388
most responsible

345
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:33,288
bought those a journalist's with the
lower technical skill set than you

346
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:36,579
that's true but they do understand just
like you and I do

347
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:40,690
just how important is to get this right
so so the New York Times took

348
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:46,210
a slight didn't read acted properly and
in the end it was possible for people to

349
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:46,779
see

350
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,878
that something was being used emotional

351
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:53,279
on Al Qaeda that is a problem with other

352
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,190
Cup it is Cup and these things do happen
in reporting

353
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,648
in journalism we have to accept that
some mistakes will be made

354
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:03,989
this is and a fundamental concept I'll
Liberty

355
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:10,179
right but you have to own that you're
giving documents with information you

356
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:10,638
know

357
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:14,690
could be harmful which could get out
there

358
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,440
yes if people

359
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,980
act in bad faith knowing talk about bad
fight took a nap

360
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,259
incompetence we are but you will never
be

361
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,430
completely free from risk if you're free

362
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,890
the only time you can be free from risk
is when you're in prison while the risks

363
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,069
were significant

364
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:38,710
snowden himself has made it clear he
feels the rewards have been worth it

365
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,339
you said in your legs Brazil I was
motivated by believe this is the world

366
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,539
deserve to understand the system in
which they live

367
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,589
my greatest fear was that no one would
listen to my warning

368
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:51,250
never by being so glad to being so long

369
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,349
how did that feel I was

370
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:57,619
initially terrify this was gonna be a
three-day story a ruse

371
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:01,279
forget about it but win I saw that

372
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,400
everybody around the world said well
hope this is a problem

373
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,430
we have to do something about this it
felt like vindication

374
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:15,039
even in america even America and I think
we're seeing something amazing

375
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,039
which is if you had ask the American
people make

376
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,140
tough decisions to confront tough

377
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,779
issues to think about heart problems and
they'll actually surprise you

378
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:32,509
okay here's the problem I did ask
americans

379
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:39,559
and boy did it surprise me I have no
idea who averaged known as never heard

380
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,089
now and now I have no idea where we're
snowed in this

381
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:48,599
I've heard the name I just can't picture
think right now

382
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,740
exactly what it is well he's I'm

383
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,000
he sold some information to people group
B opener

384
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,769
information that

385
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:01,679
shouldn't have been revealed Edward
stone revealed a lot of documents to

386
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,339
Wikileak us

387
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:08,480
average no revealed Ubuntu secret I
guess earn information in the wiki

388
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,160
WikiLeaks worse now than we he's inside
the with Julie

389
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,798
I'm been charged with leaks

390
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,990
moral ideal I guess on the plus side he
might be able to go home cuz it seems

391
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,339
like no one knows who the

392
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,890
you all expect everybody

393
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,058
on informed so

394
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:32,849
did you do this to solve a problem I did
this

395
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:37,000
to give the american people a chance to
decide for themselves

396
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,919
the kind of government they want to hang
out that he's a conversation that I

397
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,429
think

398
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,619
the American people deserve to decide or
there's no doubt is a

399
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:51,169
critical conversation but is a
conversation we have the capacity

400
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,288
to have because it's so complicated we
don't

401
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:59,548
fundamentally understand it it is a
challenging conversations I mean it's

402
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:02,788
difficult for most people to even
conceptualize

403
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:05,960
the problem is the unit is massively
complex

404
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,250
and so much so that his visible service
providers

405
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,829
technicians engineers the phone number
let let them

406
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:16,200
let me stop you right there because this
is the whole problem ride

407
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,230
there's the whole problem I just glaze
over cuz it's like the IT guy comes into

408
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,950
office we go

409
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,429
all kept in Fair Mall

410
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,369
ship don't teach me anything don't want
to learn

411
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:32,159
you smell like cancer it's real
challenge to

412
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,009
figure out how to we communicate things
that require sorted years and years of

413
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,900
technical understanding and compress
that into seconds

414
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,910
up speech I so I'm sympathetic to the
problem

415
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,859
but the thing is everything you did only
matters

416
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,500
if we have this conversation properly so
let me help you out there

417
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,769
you mentioned in an interview that the
NSA was passing around naked photos of

418
00:24:58,769 --> 00:24:59,279
people

419
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,539
yet this is something where it's its

420
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:05,980
not actually seen as a big deal

421
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,519
in the culture of an essay because you
see naked pictures

422
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,289
all the time that's terrifies people

423
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:16,970
grimly of people about backed this is
the response she gets

424
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,099
the government should not be able to get
dick pictures

425
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,170
if the government was looking at that
picture boards

426
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,559
penis I definitely feel it would be a
asiana

427
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,410
my perhaps yet that the government will
look at the room appears that would

428
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:30,920
upset me

429
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,630
they should never ever the US government
have a picture

430
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,289
have my day it might happen pat me a
picture of his penis

431
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:42,319
and the government can access it I'm I
would want that program

432
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,589
the be shutdown I would want the dick
pic

433
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:48,288
program team

434
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:53,279
I would also want the dick thing will be
correct if the program became

435
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,349
I would want to be tweaked I had wanted
to have have clear

436
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:01,450
and transparent laws that we knew about
I'm in our community just

437
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,329
not understand what they were being used
for why they are being kept

438
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:09,239
you think that programming I don't I
don't think that program exist at all

439
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,858
now now no no

440
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:16,118
if I had now is dead

441
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:20,038
the US government had a picture of my
dick I will be

442
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,648
very pisto well

443
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:30,038
the good news is there's no program
named the dick pic program

444
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,659
the bad news is there are still
collecting everybody's information

445
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,710
including your dick pics with you are
wrong on that last guy having sent a

446
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,269
dick pic

00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:41,749
recently you need to guess I'll show you

448
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:44,450
like I did

449
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,569
that the jury innocent little girl

450
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:53,410

451
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,450

so it doesn't it doesn't have to be
sending a pic to a German but no

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,380
even if you submit something with in the

article Monday I yes he'll 12 triple 3

472
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,609
is what the NSA uses when the other
authorities

473
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,960
are aggressive enough or they're not
catching as much as they'd like

474

for example has how how are they gonna
see my dick

475
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,609
I'm only concerned about my penis when
you send your junk

476
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:40,019
through Gmail for example yeah that
stored on Google's

477
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,509
servers Google moves data

478
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:47,289
from data center to data center
invisibly to you without your knowledge

479
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:51,609
your data could be moved outside the
borders at the United States

480
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:55,069
temporary when you were junk

481
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:58,589
was passed by gmail the in a sec or copy
that

482
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:01,630
prism prism is how

483
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,579
they put your junk out of Google with
Google's and Bachmann

484
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,690
all the different prism partners people
like Yahoo

485
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,990
Facebook Google the government deputize
is that

486
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,190
to be the sorta their little
surveillance

487
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,740

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,359
upstream upstream is how they snatch
your junk

489
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,819
as it transits the Internet okay mystic

490
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:29,930
if you're describing your junk on the
phone yes

491
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,829
but to help the content about junk all
or just the generational it

492
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:37,299
they have the content as well but only
for a few countries

493
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:42,069
if you are on vacation the Bahamas yes
finally and you need to remind yourself

494
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:45,220
to hunt just not sure the

495
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,880
what to do with this it's a just a lot
just hold on to it insalata

496
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,059
responsibility yeah it is a lot
responsibility that's the whole point

497
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:56,349
should I no you should absolutely not
and it's unbelievable that you would do

498
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:56,829
that

499
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,869
actually you can totally believable I

500
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:03,259
to drifting not by

501
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,369
home all K they can probably tell

502
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,769
who you're sharing your junk pictures
with because they're seeing

503
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:13,490
who your texting with who you're calling
if you called a penis enlargement

504
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,319
central three in the morning that call
lasted 90 minutes

505
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,000
they would have a record of your phone
number calling

506
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,609
that phone number which is a penis
enlargement center they would say

507
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:27,029
don't know it's a penis enlargement
center but of course they can look it up

508
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:30,650
and would if the american people
