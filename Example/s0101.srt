1
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,200
Gerald Tate's here.

2
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,600
He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.

3
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,130
Go get Harvey.

4
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,110
I check.

5
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,350
Raise.

6
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,550
5,000.

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,620
I'm all-in.

8
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,160
You can pay me later.
I got to go.

9
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,830
Gentlemen.

10
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,500
I'm paying you millions,

11
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,170
and you're telling me
I'm gonna get screwed?

12
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,900
Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?

13
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,170
Gerald, this is Harvey Specter.

14
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,380
He's our best closer.

15
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,880
Well, if you're
the best closer,

16
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,550
where the hell you been
for the last three hours?

17
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,750
Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,950
and when I left here
at 7:00 P.M.,

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,850
this deal wasn't in jeopardy,

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,420
so I'm just trying to figure out
what happened in the interim.

21
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,790
We keep offering more money.

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,290
They keep rejecting it.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,030
It's last-minute
bad faith bullsh...

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,060
Says here that Cooper
won't be staying on

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,230
as honorary vice president.

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,130
That's right.
I don't want him around.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
He wouldn't be around.

28
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,500
It's an honorary position.

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,700
I don't give a sh...

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,570
Well, I think you do,

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,410
because that's what's changed
since I left,

32
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,840
which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,040
Well, now that you've got
a grasp on what's happened

34
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,610
in the goddamn interim,

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,350
what are you gonna do about it?

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,010
Because he's not getting
that title.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,390
Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?

38
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,990
We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,790
Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,660
until we take away
the last shred of his dignity?

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,830
Bingo.
Well, that's not gonna happen.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,130
And why the hell not?
Because I like Mr. Cooper,

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,470
and my firm doesn't operate
in bad faith.

44
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,370
Oh. I see how it is.

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,610
Instead of working Cooper,

46
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,870
you're working me.

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,280
Well, why don't you take
your pansy attitude

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,880
back in there
and make him sign my deal?

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,610
Or I'll pay someone else
your money

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,150
to do it for me.
First of all, Gerald,

51
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,990
if you think
anyone's gonna touch this deal

52
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,920
after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.

53
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,360
Second, the way
our agreement works is,

54
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,990
the minute Cooper
signed the deal

55
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,560
which gave you everything
you wanted,

56
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,600
our fee was due and payable,
which is why at 7:30

57
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,670
I received confirmation
of a wire transfer

58
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,770
from escrow indicating payment
in full.

59
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,650
So I'd say
the ball's in your court,

60
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,250
but the truth is
your balls are in my fist.

61
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,720
Now I apologize if that image
is too pansy for you,

62
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,150
but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood

63
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,490
to put it out there.

64
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,120
Now get your ass in there

65
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,230
and close the goddamn deal.

66
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,990
You gonna let him talk to me
like this?

67
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,400
Harvey speaks for the firm.

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,010
We got paid
before Gerald signed the deal?

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,450
What are you talking about?
This is a memo

70
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,120
about some fire drill
on Tuesday.

71
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,780
Huh.
You're the Blue Team Captain.

72
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,690
You get to wear a fire hat.

73
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,770
Time's up.

74
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,200
Pencils down.

75
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,040
Excuse me.
Do I know you from somewhere?

76
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,970
I don't think so.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,950
I have a pretty good memory
for faces.

78
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,110
So do I.

79
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,680
Sorry.
I got it.

80
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,860
Hey. Hey!

81
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,370
Stop! You in the cap!

82
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,370
What did you get me?

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,970
What I said
I was gonna get you.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,040
A 158.
I told you I wanted a 175.

85
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,340
And I told you
only 1 out of 100 people

86
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,280
can score that.

87
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,280
You're a B-minus student.
You got 1,000 on your sats.

88
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,910
If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.

89
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,820
So only a genius loser
can get a 175?

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,350
Actually, no.
I would get a 180.

91
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,790
Now can I have my money,
please?

92
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,200
Whoa. This is only half.

93
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,700
Then why don't you
go call the police?

94
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,210
I got to get my sh... together.

95
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,210
That's the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.

96
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,750
It's from Monday, Trevor.

97
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,050
Look, man, I'm serious.

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,650
I almost got caught today.

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
I've got
to stop getting stoned.

100
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,420
I've got to get
my act together.

101
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,950
Dude, look at me.

102
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,460
You can burn bud
and still be a success.

103
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,130
You sell pot for a living.

104
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,090
Still saps the motivation.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
All I'm saying is, you want in,

106
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,260
you are in.

107
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,270
You know, that is word for word

108
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,170
your offer before I got caught

109
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,300
cheating on your math test
in the third grade.

110
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,370
Goddamn memory.

111
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,140
Stop.

112
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,340
Look, no one's gonna suspect
you're a dealer.

113
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,340
I mean, look at me.

114
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,210
This is a $2,000 suit, Mike.

115
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,680
I got, like, 12 of 'em.

116
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,450
I take on
real software projects.

117
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,150
I have clients who bring me
briefcases filled with cash,

118
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,720
and I hand them
identical briefcases

119
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,190
with vacuum-sealed bud.

120
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,990
So what do you need me for?

121
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,260
Well, I have a client
coming in from out of town,

122
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,900
and I can't meet him,

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,870
and I need someone I can trust
to make the drop.

124
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,470
It's totally safe.

125
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,200
Trevor, a person
is more likely to die

126
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,640
while dealing drugs
than they would be

127
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,900
on death row in Texas.

128
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,370
Wait.
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,710
It's from <i>Freakonomics.</i>

130
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,870
Do you read anything
that I give you?

131
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,740
It doesn't matter,

132
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,380
because you have to find
somebody else.

133
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,610
I'm not interested.

134
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,780
Not interested in what?

135
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,020
What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna stay

136
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,020
at your place tonight.

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,780
Hi, sweetie.

138
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,250
What a pleasant surprise.

139
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm so glad you stopped by.
Yeah.

140
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,390
We're in the middle
of something.

141
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,430
What are you in the middle of?

142
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,290
Trevor's trying to set me up.

143
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,660
That's terrific.

144
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,500
Who's the lucky girl?

145
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,370
I'm trying to get him
to work for me.

146
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,240
That's a great idea.

147
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,770
It will take some stress
off Trevor,

148
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
and you'll pick up writing code

149
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,810
like you do everything else.

150
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,310
All right. I got to go.

151
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,040
I got go get up early
to see my grandmother

152
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,150
and pay them another month.

153
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,710
Oh.

154
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,620
Good night.
Bye.

155
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,190
How did you know Gerald
wouldn't look at that memo?

156
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,260
Because a charging bull
always looks at the red cape,

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,790
not at the man with the sword.

158
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,930
By the way,
I've set up a meeting

159
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,130
for you and John Dockery
next week.

160
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,630
Dockery?
He's Skadden's biggest client.

161
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Not anymore.

162
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,530
He's looking around.

163
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,870
He plays tennis.
I want you to close him.

164
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,300
Consider it done.

165
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,340
Then you are
officially dismissed

166
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,210
for the evening.

167
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,880
Cheers.

168
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
Well, you two seem
to be celebrating something.

169
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,280
Mm-hmm. We are.

170
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,850
In fact, you are looking

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,150
at the best closer
this city has ever seen.

172
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,450
Closer, huh?

173
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,850
Baseball? Attorney.

174
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,350
I close situations.

175
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,260
Hmm.
So you only care about money?

176
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,090
The truth is,
I do it for the children.

177
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm Lisa.

178
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,900
Harvey.

179
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,970
Lisa, I don't normally do this,

180
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,640
but since we are celebrating,

181
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,540
what time do you get off
tonight?

182
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,540
I'm glad you asked.

183
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,850
I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."

184
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,520
I guess you're not the best
closer this city's ever seen.

185
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,460
♪ ♪

186
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,970
Good morning.

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,600
Lisa, this was lovely,

188
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,370
but I'm afraid you have to go.

189
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,110
Aw.
I hate to miss a workout,

190
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,410
and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.

191
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,680
Can't we have breakfast?

192
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,180
You could eat it
off my stomach.

193
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,450
I guess if I skip the gym,

194
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,420
I can still get in by 9:00.

195
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,900
I hear someone's
not taking their pills.

196
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,570
Because they're trying
to poison me.

197
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,770
Grammy, that's crazy.

198
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,240
Dr. shrager gave me her word

199
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,740
she wouldn't poison you
until January.

200
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,340
If she does it before then,
she can't count it

201
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,540
towards next year's quota.

202
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,710
Oh, what did I teach you?

203
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,420
Michael, I'm not gonna be
around forever.

204
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,860
And I want you to stop
with that stuff.

205
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
What stuff?

206
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,730
I may be old,

207
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,660
but I'm not an idiot.

208
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,870
I know life has been hard
for you,

209
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,370
but you're not a kid anymore,

210
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,140
and I want you to promise

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,540
you're gonna start living up
to your potential.

212
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,810
I promise.

213
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm not saying that I haven't
been charmed by Harvey,

214
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,920
but it's just so patronizing

215
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,660
when you say
that he can handle those things

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,190
and, "Louis,
you can only handle this."

217
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,090
Jessica, I could have handled
Gerald Tate.

218
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,430
And I told you I disagree.

219
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,330
Why?
Because when you put

220
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,660
two bullies
in the same room together,

221
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,660
things generally
don't go so well.

222
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,130
It's 9:30.
Nice of you to show up

223
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
two hours after we open
for business.

224
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,040
And I see that you're also
trying to look like a pimp.

225
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,900
My bad, Louis.
I was out late last night.

226
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,840
And when I woke up,
this is the suit

227
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,170
your wife picked out for me.

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,810
And that would be funny

229
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,610
if I'd actually been married.
Moving along.

230
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,780
You're not married?
Recruiting. Harvey.

231
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,480
Your interviews are set up
for tomorrow.

232
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,980
What? Why don't we just hire

233
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,850
the Harvard summer associate
douche?

234
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,020
I think if you listen
to the phrasing

235
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,020
of that question,
you'll come up with an answer.

236
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,830
We need people who think
on their feet,

237
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,390
not another clone
with a rod up his ass.

238
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,360
Harvey, the fact
that we only hire from Harvard

239
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,300
gives us a cache
that's a little more valuable

240
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,900
than hiring a kid from Rutgers.

241
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,670
You went to Harvard law.

242
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,570
I'm an exception.

243
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,170
Find me another one.

244
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,010
Can we please skip
the recruiting?

245
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,710
I work better alone anyway.

246
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,310
Well, I would, Harvey,

247
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,350
except all senior partners
get an associate.

248
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,220
It's just a rule.

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm sorry. What?

250
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,150
Jessica, I deserve
that promotion.

251
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,920
My billables destroy his.

252
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,390
And I'm here night and day
doing whatever's needed

253
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,990
instead of swanning
in and out of here

254
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,730
whenever I please.

255
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,200
I must admit, he does make me
sound very swan-like.

256
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,300
Harvey,

257
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,170
shut up.

258
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,100
Louis, this is how it is.

259
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,440
All right,
now you two make nice.

260
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,940
Louis, I apologize.
I was out of line.

261
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,710
Now if you'll just let me text
your pretend wife

262
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,980
that I just made senior partner,
I... what?

263
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,980
Your grandmother's
getting worse.

264
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,920
I need to move her to full care

265
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,950
or I'll have to transfer her
to the state facility.

266
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,920
I won't put her
in a state facility.

267
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,420
Then I'm afraid you'll have
to come up with $25,000.

268
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,830
Trevor, I'm in.

269
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,230
One-time deal. I want 25.

270
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Take it or leave it.

271
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,530
I'll take it.

272
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,670
There's a briefcase in my room.

273
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,840
Pick it up tomorrow,

274
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,540
take it to room 2412

275
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,000
at the Chilton Hotel.

276
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,640
Now you can't go
to a luxury hotel

277
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,510
looking like a delivery guy,
so shave,

278
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,410
comb your hair, buy a suit.

279
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,140
That's a hell
of a lot to ask, man.

280
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,580
Well, I'm not asking you.
I'm paying you $25,000.

281
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,610
Okay?

282
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,480
Yeah, he's in.

283
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,850
Good.

284
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,020
I'm gonna go take a piss.

285
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,160
Key.

286
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,360
24 hours, we'll know

287
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,460
if this new buyer's a cop.

288
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,770
Why didn't you tell Trevor
he might be sending

289
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,330
his guy into a setup?

290
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,330
Same reason
why I don't tell Gina

291
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,570
I'm banging her sister.

292
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,240
It'll only cause trouble.

293
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,610
What's up?

294
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm just gonna take off.

295
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,280
I don't think you should.

296
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,320
Why don't you stay with us
till tomorrow?

297
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,250
Now give me your cell phone.

298
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,720
Give me your phone.

299
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,050
Don't even think
about warning your boy.

300
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,590
'Cause if these guys are cops,
whoever's holding that weed

301
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,460
is going to jail
for a long time.

302
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,630
Hey.

303
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,600
Hey. God, you scared the hell
out of me.

304
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,640
Sorry.

305
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,810
Look at you.

306
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,410
You look great. Thanks.

307
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,980
Tell me you decided
to work with Trevor.

308
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,810
Yeah. Trial basis. Yeah.

309
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,690
What are you doing here?

310
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,390
My mom is coming
by my place later.

311
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,520
And I don't want to mess it up,

312
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,460
so I'm hanging here.

313
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,490
Got to go.

314
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,200
Hey. Come here.

315
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,570
Mm.

316
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,570
You want to look perfect
on your first day.

317
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah.

318
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,080
I've got to go.

319
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,950
Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,530
Great. Thanks.

321
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,570
Donna, we're gonna need
to streamline this.

322
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,400
Give each guy a hard time.

323
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,970
Before you send them back,

324
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,570
give me a wink
if they say something clever.

325
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,310
Cool? Okay.

326
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
What are you looking for?

327
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,650
Another me.

328
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,610
So, chip,

329
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,510
what makes you think

330
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,110
that I'm gonna let
the whitest man

331
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,310
that I have ever seen
interview for our firm?

332
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,210
Because I have an appointment.

333
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,850
Hmm.

334
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,010
You can do this.

335
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,890
Kid, what is wrong with you?

336
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,230
You look
like you're 11 years old.

337
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I was late to puberty.

338
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,200
Harvey Specter.

339
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,170
Uh, excuse me.

340
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,300
I was thinking
about going for a swim.

341
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,600
Are the pool facilities here
nice?

342
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,840
Of course, sir.

343
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,940
This is the Chilton Hotel.

344
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,040
And do you have the time?

345
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,110
Yes, uh...

346
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,280
10:00. Thanks.

347
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,790
He saw your gun.
You think that's him?

348
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,500
Matches the description.

349
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,230
But he didn't go in the room.

350
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
It's 10:00 exactly.
He's just walking by?

351
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,310
Go after him.
Stay on the radio.

352
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,600
Rick Sorkin.

353
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,000
Rick Sorkin.

354
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,140
Rick Sorkin?

355
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,410
Excuse me, Mr. Sorkin,

356
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,940
you are five minutes late.

357
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,680
Is there a reason
why I should let you in?

358
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,280
Look, I'm just trying
to ditch the cops, okay?

359
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,020
I don't really care
if you let me in or not.

360
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,560
Mr. Specter will be
right with you.

361
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,030
What?

362
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,930
Can I get you anything?
A coffee or a bottle of water?

363
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
Hi, Rick Sorkin.

364
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,970
Harvey Specter.
Nice to meet you.

365
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,470
Why don't you have a seat here?

366
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,640
Whoa. What's this?

367
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,820
Can I help you?

368
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,290
No.

369
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,390
How the hell did you know
they were the police?

370
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,830
I read this novel
in elementary school,

371
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,230
and it was
the exact same thing.

372
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,930
You read a novel
in elementary school.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,200
What? I like to read.

374
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,640
And why'd you ask them
what time it was?

375
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,000
Throw 'em off.

376
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,370
What kind of drug dealer

377
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,040
asks a cop what time it is

378
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,840
when he's got a briefcase
full of pot, right?

379
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,180
We should hire you.

380
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,980
Jesus, I'd give you
the 25 grand

381
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,250
as a signing bonus.

382
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,680
I'll take it.

383
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,450
Unfortunately,

384
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,090
we only hire from Harvard.

385
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,420
And you not only did not go
to Harvard law school,

386
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,630
you haven't even gone
to any law school.

387
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,100
What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

388
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,360
like no one you've ever met,

389
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,300
and I've actually passed
the bar?

390
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,700
I'd say you're full of crap.

391
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,410
That's a barbri legal handbook
right there, right?

392
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,040
Open it up. Read me something.

393
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,110
Anything.

394
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,450
"Civil liability associated
with agency is based

395
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,880
on several factors..."
"Including the deviation

396
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,450
"of the agent from his path,

397
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,420
"the reasonable inference
of agency on behalf

398
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,550
"of the plaintiff,
and the nature

399
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,360
of the damages themselves."

400
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,430
How did you know that?

401
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,300
I learned it when I studied
for the bar.

402
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,200
Okay, hotshot,

403
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,140
fire up this laptop.

404
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,870
I'm gonna show you

405
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,380
what a Harvard attorney can do.

406
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,580
Pick a topic.

407
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,250
Stock option backdating.

408
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,220
Although backdating options
is legal,

409
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,950
violations arise
related to disclosures

410
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,090
under IRC section 409A.

411
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,260
You forgot
about sarbanes-oxley.

412
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,790
The statute of limitations

413
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,400
renders sarbanes-oxley moot
post 2007.

414
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,260
Not if you can find actions

415
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,030
to cover up the violation

416
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,700
as established in
the sixth circuit, may 2008.

417
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,770
That's impressive, but you're
sitting at a computer.

418
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,880
Playing hearts.

419
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,650
Sorry. If you want to beat me,

420
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,380
you're gonna have to do it
at something else.

421
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,250
How can you know all that?

422
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,780
I told you. I like to read.

423
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,650
And once I read something,
I understand it.

424
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,860
And once I understand it,
I never forget it.

425
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,490
Why take the bar?

426
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,300
This dickhead bet me
I couldn't pass it

427
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,500
without going to law school.

428
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,170
Okay, look,

429
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,370
this is
all pretty fascinating stuff,

430
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,540
but I'm afraid
I got to get back to work.

431
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,140
I'll make sure
that serpico isn't around

432
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,140
waiting for you.

433
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,530
You want this job so much,

434
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,430
why didn't you just go
to law school?

435
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,830
When I was in college,

436
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,400
it was my dream to be a lawyer.

437
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,870
I needed some money,

438
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,070
and Trevor convinced me

439
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,140
to memorize this math test

440
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,200
and to sell it.

441
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,370
Turns out we sold it
to the Dean's daughter.

442
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,880
I lost my scholarship,
I got kicked out of school,

443
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,610
I...

444
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,090
I got knocked
into a different life.

445
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,450
And I have been wishing
for a way back ever since.

446
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,030
Let me tell you something.

447
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,730
This isn't elementary school.
This is hard work.

448
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,730
Long hours. High pressure.

449
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,900
I need a grown goddamn man.

450
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,970
You give me this,

451
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,970
and I will work
as hard as it takes

452
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,680
to school those Harvard douches

453
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,510
and become the best lawyer
you have ever seen.

454
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,950
I'm inclined
to give you a shot,

455
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,480
but what if I decide
to go another way?

456
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,820
I'd say that's fair.

457
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,250
Sometimes I like to hang out
with people

458
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,020
who aren't that bright,
you know,

459
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,190
just to see
how the other half lives.

460
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,490
Move over.

461
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm emailing the firm
I just found our next associate.

462
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
All right.
You're gonna start a week

463
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,800
from Monday.

464
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,200
Here's what you're gonna do.

465
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,100
First, no more pot.
We drug test.

466
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,640
Stop smoking now,
you'll be fine,

467
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,170
I assume that's all the drugs
you do.

468
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,940
How do you know that?
You read books, I read people.

469
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,250
And potheads smoke pot.
That's what they do.

470
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,120
It's not all I do.
I have interests.

471
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,580
You're Albert
friggin' Einstein,

472
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,250
and you couldn't manage
to get into law school?

473
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,590
You think that's not
from smoking weed?

474
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,960
Trevor got...
That's another thing.

475
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,860
You're never gonna talk
to Trevor again.

476
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,460
You're gonna ditch
that briefcase,

477
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,290
and you're gonna get on a plane
to Harvard,

478
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,930
and you're gonna learn
everything there is

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,030
about going
to law school there.

480
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,060
Did you buy that suit? Yeah.

481
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,830
Let's buy some new ones.

482
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,710
Hi.

483
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,280
How do I sign up
for today's law school tour?

484
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,480
You go back in time six weeks

485
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,910
because
that's when it booked up.

486
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,620
Um...

487
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,980
This is Harvard law.

488
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,090
We get over 7,000 applications
a year.

489
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,590
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

490
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,930
Thank you.

491
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,900
Eduardo Fernandez,
who, first of all,

492
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,670
looks like he works
at the public pool or something,

493
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,400
and he comes up to me
the other day,

494
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,700
and I completely know
he's a freshman.

495
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,110
And he looks at me and he goes,

496
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,340
"Where's
the public health school?"

497
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,980
Which is right
around the corner,

498
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,280
and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?

499
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,950
Excuse me.

500
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,010
Can I help you?

501
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,750
Jonathan atwater.

502
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,380
I work for Dean wormer
in the admissions office.

503
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,650
Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?

504
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,420
Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here

505
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,720
to invite you
to a small cocktail hour

506
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,760
for some of
our more realistic candidates.

507
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,060
And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,

508
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,330
so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,

509
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,630
you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.

510
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,600
Congratulations.

511
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,740
Harvard law
is the oldest law school

512
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,410
in the country and boasts

513
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,950
the most successful graduates
in the world.

514
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,180
Currently, we are six
of nine supreme court justices

515
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,790
and, of course, the president
of the United States.

516
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,600
Uh, hi, good morning.

517
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,630
I'm here to see... Have a seat.

518
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,640
Thank you.

519
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,390
Mike Ross?

520
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,590
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.

521
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

522
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,800
Wow. You're pretty.
Good. You've hit on me.

523
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,200
We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.

524
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,340
No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.

525
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Trust me.

526
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,010
I've given dozens of these,

527
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,940
and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is

528
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,310
thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,

529
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,080
that I will
somehow be blown away

530
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,510
by his dazzling degree.

531
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,810
Let me assure you, I won't.

532
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,350
I was. I was hitting on you.

533
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,190
You were. Take notes.

534
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

535
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,830
I love you.

536
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,860
The firm operates
on a chain of command model.

537
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,470
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

538
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,330
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

539
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,970
so you'll also answer to him.

540
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,770
What do you think about Harvey?

541
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,540
People are in awe of him.

542
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,270
They say he's the best closer
there is,

543
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,610
but I have very little contact
with him,

544
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,810
so I don't know.

545
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,180
And what about Louis Litt?

546
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,320
Let's continue with your tour.

547
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,550
Hey, Becky. You are glowing.

548
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,150
I wonder why that is. Oh, yeah.

549
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,490
It's the day
they announce my promotion.

550
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,060
Jimmy, have you lost weight?

551
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,190
Steve-O.

552
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,930
Looking like a guy
who came to work.

553
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,230
Excuse me,
why are you scratching off

554
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,570
the senior off my door?

555
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,570
I got a work order
to take it off.

556
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,570
Who issued the work order?
My supervisor.

557
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,570
Why did he issue
the work order?

558
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,580
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.

559
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,440
You seem
to be enjoying yourself.

560
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,850
I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.

561
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,680
Donna!

562
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,250
Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.

563
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,950
Jessica wants to see you
in her office.

564
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,720
Now.

565
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:50,590
And finally,
this is where you'll live.

566
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,430
Wow.

567
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,600
I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.

568
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,830
That's because...
Because you were

569
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,470
too busy ogling me to listen

570
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,770
to a word I've said?

571
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,270
Partners' offices
anchor the wings.

572
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,910
Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.

573
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,610
All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.

574
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,980
I answer to Harvey

575
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,650
and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way

576
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,420
you responded to my questions,

577
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,090
I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.

578
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,790
You have been here
for five years,

579
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,220
and just because I outrank you

580
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,390
does not mean
I have the authority

581
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,630
to command your services.

582
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,060
Oh, it's also pretty clear

583
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,500
that you think you're too smart

584
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,630
to be a paralegal.

585
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,000
You know what nobody likes?

586
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,740
Nobody likes a showoff.

587
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,110
You used the word "ogling."

588
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,280
When do I get to see Harvey?

589
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,580
Gerald Tate fired the firm.

590
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,780
So you're taking
my promotion away.

591
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,650
You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar

592
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,280
and have your license stripped.

593
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,090
You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.

594
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,490
I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing

595
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,060
and honor his goddamn contract.

596
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,330
And you didn't seem
to mind so much

597
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,630
when you thought
I got away with it.

598
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,830
But you didn't get away
with it.

599
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,270
And I can't justify handing you
a promotion

600
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,630
on the same day that you lose
a huge client.

601
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,270
One client doesn't make a firm.

602
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,770
I don't know if you've noticed,

603
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,140
but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.

604
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,580
Companies
aren't exactly lining up

605
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,440
to spend money
on attorneys right now.

606
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,550
And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying

607
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,880
had you not humiliated him.

608
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,350
But you did,
and you need to accept that.

609
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,420
Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,

610
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,460
I'd be heading for the door.

611
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,190
If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,

612
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,060
I'd be throwing you
out the window.

613
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,170
But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.

614
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,070
You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,

615
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
and instead
of covering your ass,

616
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,670
I will put you
in front of the bar myself.

617
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,380
Mike.
Hey.

618
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,950
Who's ready
for a great first day?

619
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,850
I'm gonna have to let you go.

620
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,890
What?
I just got reamed

621
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,490
for lying to a client,

622
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,160
and if they find out
that I lied about you

623
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,490
going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.

624
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
You what?

625
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,330
Not now, Donna.

626
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,900
Look, I have to put
my own interests

627
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,400
above yours.
It's nothing personal.

628
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,000
You're fired.

629
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,470
Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,

630
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,810
then they might find out
that you lied about me

631
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,210
and you'll lose your license.

632
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,480
But if you fire me,
then I could tell them

633
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,110
that you lied about me,

634
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,680
and you'd definitely lose
your license.

635
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,320
Are you telling me that

636
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,850
if I throw you under the bus,

637
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,290
you're gonna drag me with you?

638
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,320
You put your interests
above mine,

639
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,890
and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.

640
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,100
You're rehired.

641
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,900
So should I... all right.

642
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,440
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back

643
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,800
my promotion,
and that's the last

644
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,970
we're gonna talk about this.

645
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,670
And why is that?

646
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,510
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town

647
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,340
and join Rick Peterson.

648
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,310
I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,

649
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,180
and I'm gonna
take them with me.

650
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,980
You do that,
and you'll force me

651
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,550
to put you in front
of the ethics board.

652
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,290
I don't think you will.
And why not?

653
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,920
Because you were obligated
to notify them

654
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,060
the second I lied to Gerald,
but you didn't.

655
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,830
You put me in front
of the board right now,

656
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,160
I'll put you right up there
with me.

657
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,730
Hmm.

658
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,140
I'll... I'll give you
your promotion.

659
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,910
But you have to do something
for me.

660
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,140
Anything.

661
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,480
Ah. Pro Bono.

662
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,580
Anything but that.

663
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,150
Harvey, Pro Bono cases

664
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,990
are how we, as a firm,
show that we care

665
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,520
about more than just ourselves.

666
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,790
I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.

667
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,290
I'm saying I shouldn't do them.

668
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,860
And it's how you can show me

669
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,360
that you care about more
than just yourself.

670
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,660
You'll handle this yourself.

671
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,030
You will not pass it off.

672
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,630
Absolutely.

673
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,040
Your first case.

674
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,070
Awesome. What is it?

675
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,080
Pro Bono.

676
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,680
Sexual harassment.

677
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,780
Don't tell anyone
I laid it off on you,

678
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,610
and don't screw it up. Got it.

679
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,650
You can't handle it.
I'll knock it out of the park.

680
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,750
Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.

681
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,860
Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?

682
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,960
I spent $500.

683
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,900
For how many suits?

684
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,200
Five.

685
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,600
What?

686
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,200
Nancy?

687
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,870
Mike?
Yeah, hi.

688
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,170
You're a kid.

689
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
No, I'm a... I'm a grown man.

690
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,040
You're so skinny. Have a grape.

691
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,750
Thank you.

692
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,780
Why don't you tell me
your story?

693
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,480
It started two years ago.

694
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,950
I was a stay-at-home mom

695
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,920
to my son, Freddie.

696
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,820
And one day
we were at little league,

697
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,460
Freddie was five.

698
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,890
He really hated
that he couldn't play

699
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,290
with the older kids.

700
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,860
It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.

701
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,200
My husband had been
in a car accident,

702
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,260
and he was gone,
just like that.

703
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,630
I'm so sorry.

704
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,740
I did the best I could.

705
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,610
I got myself a job
as a secretary

706
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,970
at Devlin McGreggor.

707
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,240
And I even got promoted

708
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,510
to secretary of the president,

709
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,610
Charles Hunt.

710
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,750
And that's when it all changed.

711
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,150
It's okay.
Tell me what happened.

712
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,390
He started asking me
to stay late,

713
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,560
order in dinners together,
stuff like that.

714
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,930
One night, he says
that if I sleep with him,

715
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,360
he's gonna take care of me
in the firm,

716
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,960
and, if I don't,
he's gonna fire me.

717
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,200
So what did you do?

718
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,530
I went to human resources.

719
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,500
They said they investigated,

720
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,970
couldn't find anything
to support my claim.

721
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,510
Two months later, I was fired

722
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,280
for poor job performance.

723
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,950
They wouldn't let me
say good-bye to anybody.

724
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,310
They wouldn't write me
a letter of recommendation.

725
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,980
I wasn't looking for a payoff.

726
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,450
All I wanted
was for it to stop.

727
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,390
Can you help me?

728
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,390
Uh, yes.

729
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,790
Yes, I can.

730
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,330
What do you need my help for?

731
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,430
Wait, can I just...
No, give me the update.

732
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,730
You know, she's a nice woman.

733
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,170
She... On the case.

734
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,630
I don't get
emotionally attached

735
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,030
to the client.

736
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,840
This woman had
her life ripped apart.

737
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,440
You don't even care?

738
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,140
I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.

739
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,010
Why can't you be about both?

740
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,580
I'd explain it to you,

741
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,880
but then I'd have
to care about you.

742
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,520
What are you doing?

743
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,750
Don't touch that.

744
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,520
I'm just checking my lock.

745
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,690
You ride your bike to...

746
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,720
It's locked, okay?

747
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,330
Come on.

748
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,300
Defense sent over
the investigation files

749
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,900
as a courtesy. No, they didn't.

750
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,370
Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.

751
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,000
They sent those files

752
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,210
because that's
where they want you to look.

753
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,510
Listen, being a lawyer's

754
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,480
like being a doctor.

755
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,880
You mean how you don't get
emotional about the client?

756
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,080
No, I mean you keep pressing
until it hurts.

757
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,580
Then you know where to look.

758
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,320
Forget about impeaching
the investigation.

759
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,120
It won't lead anywhere.
No employee's gonna testify

760
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,620
against their own CEO. Okay.

761
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,490
So what do you suggest I do?

762
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Think.
This guy's done this once...

763
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,360
He's done it before.

764
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,790
And if the people
who work for him now

765
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,290
won't testify against him...

766
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,900
Someone who used
to work for him might.

767
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,400
You know what,

768
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,100
I'd subpoena
the personnel records

769
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,630
of every woman
who's left the firm

770
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,200
during this guy's tenure.
That's funny.

771
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,800
That's exactly what I thought.

772
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,340
Then what do you need
my help for?

773
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,810
I don't know
how to fill out a subpoena.

774
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,680
Figure it out yourself.

775
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,880
Donna, can you show me
how to fill out a subpoena?

776
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,450
Absolutely. And after that,

777
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,990
you want me to show you
how to wipe your ass?

778
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,050
It's funny,
because you should already know

779
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,420
how to do both those things.

780
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,320
Ha, yeah, that's hilarious.

781
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,430
What's that?
That's my suit guy.

782
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,630
Go in, tell him I sent you,
and spend some money.

783
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,060
What does it matter
how much money I spend on suits?

784
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,670
People respond
to how we're dressed,

785
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,230
so like it or not,
this is what you have to do.

786
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,240
That's weird,
you giving me advice.

787
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,670
It sounds like you actually care
about me.

788
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,540
I don't.
You're a reflection of me,

789
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,340
and I absolutely care about me.

790
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,680
So get your skinny tie
out of my face and get to work.

791
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,980
That was a little harsh.

792
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,550
Really?

793
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,320
Yeah.

794
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,490
Mike.

795
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Where are you going?

796
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,260
It's 6:30. I'm going home.

797
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,100
Okay. What's so funny?

798
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,730
You're a rookie associate.

799
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,270
If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,

800
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,410
you're not gonna make it
through your first month.

801
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,870
And Louis Litt
wants to see you.

802
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,880
Hey, can I ask you something?
Mm-hmm.

803
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,410
This tie, is it too skinny?

804
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,650
Yeah.

805
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,720
Right.

806
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,680
Yeah.

807
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,490
I know you had orientation
from Rachel,

808
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,370
but I wanted to give you
a special welcome from me.

809
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,700
Amongst other things,
I'm sort of the disciplinarian

810
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,700
of the associates.

811
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,010
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

812
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,480
Gary, please come in.
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.

813
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,410
Gary's one of our most promising
associates from last year.

814
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,180
Hi.

815
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,950
Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,

816
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,490
have you completed
the petramco filing?

817
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,190
Well, my brother was in
over the weekend,

818
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,390
so I didn't really get to it.

819
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,160
Look, I mean, Gary, come on.

820
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,330
This is, like, the third time
I've had to ask.

821
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,790
I'll get right on it.

822
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't bother. You're fired.

823
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,500
What? You can't fire me.

824
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,130
Oh, yes, I can. And I just did.

825
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,830
Go pack up your things.

826
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,070
Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.

827
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,310
See, I arranged
for you to see that

828
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,850
because we pay our associates
very well

829
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,690
and we provide the opportunity
for unlimited advancement.

830
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,190
But in return
we expect results.

831
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,900
Have I made myself clear?

832
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,130
Yeah.

833
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,040
Great.

834
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,140
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

835
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,510
Feel free to go back to work.

836
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,150
Harvey.

837
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,290
Okay, I have two words for you.

838
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,990
Absolutely beautiful.

839
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,490
You think you're the only one
who can charm a client?

840
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,330
Categorically stunning.

841
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,360
How's the new kid working out?

842
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,530
Regally hot.

843
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,230
You're an idiot.
Jessica Pearson.

844
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Good night, Harvey.

845
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,310
What are you doing here?

846
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,820
Watching <i>sportscenter.</i>

847
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,480
Boo-yah.

848
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,890
You won't return
my phone calls.

849
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,050
Ah, yeah,
because you set me up.

850
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,290
Do you remember that?
You think I knew about that?

851
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,060
Here we go.
Round 50 of I get the shaft

852
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,260
because you didn't know
the whole story.

853
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,060
You knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap

854
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,330
from that book.

855
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,970
Okay, you needed money,

856
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,370
and I came through
with an opportunity

857
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,240
like always.

858
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Besides, you weren't
the only one who got screwed.

859
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,710
They pulled a gun on me.

860
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,810
Oh, really?

861
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,180
And why did they do that?

862
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,440
To keep me from warning you.

863
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,110
So you did know.

864
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,610
Well, not until
after it was too late.

865
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,210
Well, it's too late now.

866
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,050
Look, let me make it up to you.

867
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,720
Oh, you want
to make it up to me?

868
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,620
Give me my key back.

869
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,200
Michael.

870
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,300
Come on.

871
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,530
You know I don't want
to live in a world

872
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,740
where we're not tight.

873
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,540
Then kill yourself.

874
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,140
Get out.

875
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Get the hell out.

876
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,540
Donna, I need the...

877
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,340
oh, also I didn't have
a chance to...

878
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,970
marry me?
I took care of that too.

879
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,640
We've been married
for the last seven years.

880
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,740
Excellent.

881
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,820
Umm, Devlin McGreggor's
fighting the subpoena.

882
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,640
They filed a motion
to dismiss the case

883
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,970
based on our lack of evidence.

884
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,950
Good.
Good.

885
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,520
Wait, what do you mean, "good"?

886
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,950
They don't want
to hand over the files.

887
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,420
You pressed where it hurt.

888
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,960
You're looking
in the right place.

889
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,190
Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?

890
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,920
Well, I...
now that you mention it.

891
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,390
Oh, my bad.

892
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,760
I keep forgetting

893
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,160
you don't
actually know anything.

894
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,860
The idea is,

895
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,670
you make a move,
they make a move.

896
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,330
You go back and forth
until one of you wins.

897
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,940
Okay, what if they win
the motion

898
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
and the case gets dismissed?

899
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,170
You're not as good
as you think you are.

900
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,310
Harvey. What a coincidence.

901
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,980
I was wondering
how the Pro Bono was coming.

902
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,050
I'm all over it.

903
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,350
That makes me very happy,

904
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,980
because if I were to find out

905
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,220
that you weren't putting in
your full effort,

906
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,480
I'd be very upset.

907
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,890
No worries. We're all good.

908
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,630
Rachel! Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel. I need your help.

909
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,000
There's a hearing
on my subpoena.

910
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,570
I've got three cases
in front of you,

911
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,570
so you're gonna have
to wait in line.

912
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
No. No, no, no.

913
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,240
My hearing is tomorrow.

914
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,570
So why are you coming to me?

915
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,370
Because Donna says

916
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,780
you're the best researcher
in the firm.

917
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,750
Let me see the motion.

918
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

919
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,920
You have an office?

920
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,650
How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?

921
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,850
Like you said,
I'm the best researcher

922
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,690
in the firm. Really?

923
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,260
I just made that up.

924
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,730
I didn't even have time
to talk to Donna.

925
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,800
Is this all a joke to you?

926
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,000
'Cause I take my job seriously.

927
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,470
No, I'm sorry.

928
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,900
Look, I was...

929
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,370
look, you weren't there, okay.

930
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,740
I care about this woman.

931
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,880
She's got
nowhere else to turn...

932
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,380
and you can't help her
by yourself.

933
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,680
I can.

934
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,580
I just prefer not to.

935
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,090
Okay.

936
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,490
You're asking to look
at private files

937
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,920
without any evidence
of your assertion.

938
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,090
Yeah, but the only way
that we can find

939
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,890
the evidence is to look
at those files.

940
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,890
It's a rickety argument.

941
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,060
But is there a precedent?

942
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,870
Let's go see
if we can find one.

943
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,440
Research is as much art
as science,

944
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,140
so we're gonna look
at privacy and harassment law

945
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,510
so you can find a combination
of cases

946
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,310
to make an argument.
I'll take privacy.

947
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,940
I'll take harassment law.

948
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,510
This'll take a while.

949
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,180
We're gonna need dinner.

950
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,320
Chinese.
No.

951
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,750
I can afford Chinese on my own.

952
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,550
This is on the firm.
I want sushi.

953
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,260
Ooh.

954
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,460
So they told me to put
my top investigator on it.

955
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,760
What did you do?
What could I do?

956
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,530
You were out of the country,
I gave them Luderman.

957
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,770
By the way, that dress...

958
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,100
What, this old thing? Come on.

959
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,200
Beautiful.

960
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,010
Vanessa, why don't we do this
more often?

961
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,010
'Cause it always ends
the same way.

962
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,210
Then why are we doing it now?

963
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,680
Harvey, I don't sleep around.

964
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,110
And I could never be
in a relationship with you.

965
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,350
All you ever think about
is yourself.

966
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,990
I'm thinking about you and me
right now.

967
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,660
Please. I insist.

968
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,860
But I'm a gentleman.

969
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,030
Besides, you came through

970
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,930
on Dockery for me,
and I'm not one

971
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,830
to forget a favor.

972
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,840
Neither am I.

973
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,650
Mr. Dockery,
you naughty, naughty boy.

974
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,890
You remember when I said
you thought you were too smart

975
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,190
to be a paralegal? Mm-hmm.

976
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,290
Why...
Aren't I a lawyer?

977
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
Mm.

978
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,960
I don't test well. What?

979
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,060
I am smart.

980
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,700
And I know
I'd be a good lawyer.

981
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,130
I just... I don't know
what it is.

982
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,100
I can't take tests,

983
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,140
and I bombed the lsats.

984
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,570
And even if I could get

985
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,770
into law school, there's no way

986
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,710
I'd pass the bar.

987
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,310
So if only there was someone
who could take the test for me.

988
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,680
Yeah, if only there were.
Yeah.

989
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,550
Hi. Where are you at
with the research

990
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,960
for tomorrow's hearing?
Nothing yet.

991
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,960
You say you care
about the client,

992
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,390
but if you keep playing footsie

993
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,990
instead of finding me
an argument,

994
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,690
the client's gonna lose.

995
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,260
I don't want to lose.

996
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,500
Ugh.

997
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,970
Look, it's no use.

998
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,370
Okay, their investigation's
by the book.

999
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,710
We look like the bad guys
coming in,

1000
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,110
putting them under duress.

1001
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,910
What did you just say?

1002
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,280
I said we look
like the bad guys.

1003
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,180
No, you said

1004
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,750
they did it by the book

1005
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,450
and we're putting them
under duress.

1006
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,190
Yeah.

1007
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,860
Look.
Hmm.

1008
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,760
This is good.
We're gonna have some fun.

1009
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,700
We? I get to go?

1010
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,160
You didn't think
I'd let you come along?

1011
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,230
No.
Good instinct. I wasn't.

1012
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,770
But then I thought
it'd be cruel

1013
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,500
not to let you witness
my greatness.

1014
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,810
Okay, can I go get my bag?
No.

1015
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,680
You're a true giver.
Other side.

1016
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,780
Okay.

1017
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,850
Your honor, this case
should be thrown out.

1018
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,680
Other than her story,
the plaintiff doesn't have

1019
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,620
one piece of evidence.

1020
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,750
Because the evidence lies
within their personnel files,

1021
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,390
which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.

1022
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,260
Those files contain
sensitive information.

1023
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,890
He's fishing at the expense

1024
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,500
of our employees' right
to privacy.

1025
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,860
Please.
They don't give a rat's ass

1026
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,800
about his employees' right
to privacy.

1027
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,840
Sorry, that's actually unfair
to rats' asses.

1028
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,840
Your honor, Mr. Specter's
claim that we don't care

1029
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,940
about our employees,
though belittling,

1030
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,440
doesn't carry any weight
as a rule of law.

1031
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,850
True, but what does carry
weight is that an investigation

1032
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,580
of sexual harassment
must be conducted

1033
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,880
without any duress.

1034
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,180
Your point?

1035
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,180
The investigator
and every person

1036
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,250
being interviewed
answers to the ceo

1037
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,650
they're investigating.

1038
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,460
That is the definition
of duress.

1039
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,760
It'd be as if your bailiff

1040
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,160
accused you of sexual harassment

1041
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,700
and you assigned
your stenographer

1042
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,970
to investigate.

1043
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,440
Now how likely would it be

1044
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,540
that this investigation
yielded any fruit?

1045
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:01,640
You honestly think
I would harass Herman?

1046
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,080
Well, I don't know, your honor.

1047
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,840
Some people have a thing
for the uniform.

1048
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,910
Ugh. I'd like to think
Herman would come to me

1049
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,180
before it even got
to an investigation.

1050
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,750
I saw that.
That should be stricken.

1051
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,120
But what if Herman did come
to you, your honor?

1052
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,030
And you betrayed his trust

1053
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,230
by firing him
under false pretenses?

1054
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,060
You really think
that little of me?

1055
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,470
I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you.

1056
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,640
Your honor.

1057
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,170
Hand over the files...

1058
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,640
Oh...
Today.

1059
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,540
That's it.

1060
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:39,010
Herman, I'd like to speak
to you in chambers.

1061
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,780
That was awesome.

1062
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,850
It was your argument.

1063
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,350
I just framed it in a way

1064
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,820
that humanized the situation

1065
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,360
and brightened
all of our afternoons.

1066
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,990
I feel like Michael corleone
in that scene

1067
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,060
where that fat guy teaches him
how to shoot that gun.

1068
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,160
Are you saying
that I'm the fat guy?

1069
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,600
'Cause I'm not the fat guy.

1070
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,200
Mm.

1071
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,870
You know what his name was?

1072
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,440
Yeah.
Cordoza.

1073
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,870
Clemenza.
I knew that.

1074
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,240
I was just testing
to see if you knew it.

1075
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,840
I knew that you knew
that I knew.

1076
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,620
♪ ♪

1077
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,560
Train wreck.

1078
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,890
Hey, I'm looking

1079
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,230
for rene.

1080
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,060
I'm rene. I'm sorry.

1081
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,770
We don't sell skinny jeans
at this location.

1082
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,100
Did Harvey tell you
I was coming, or...?

1083
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,000
Harvey Specter sent you?

1084
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,070
That's another story.

1085
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,610
Do you know your inseam?

1086
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,240
I don't.
It's probably a medium.

1087
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,250
Oh. Why don't you browse
for a while?

1088
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,380
These are the most exclusive,

1089
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,480
and we move down in price

1090
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,290
as you head to the door.

1091
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,360
Oh. Okay.

1092
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,030
Large?

1093
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,730
That's not how it works.

1094
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,140
Huh.

1095
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,350
So Trevor's getting you to do
his dirty work for him, huh?

1096
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,050
All I know is you
aren't talking to each other.

1097
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,050
I miss you.

1098
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,390
I want things

1099
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,820
to go back
to the way they were.

1100
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,220
I miss you too. But...

1101
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,890
I'm not sure
things are ever going back

1102
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,090
to the way they were.

1103
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,730
I gotta go.

1104
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,300
What did he say?

1105
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,800
He said things
aren't ever going back

1106
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,470
to the way they were.

1107
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,270
What did you do?

1108
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,040
I don't know.

1109
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,140
Hey.

1110
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,050
So the files are on their way.

1111
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,410
We won?

1112
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,410
That's fantastic.

1113
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,780
So now we have a week

1114
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,050
to corroborate Nancy's story.

1115
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,390
Listen, I couldn't have done it
without you.

1116
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,090
You wouldn't even know
where to look without me.

1117
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,230
You know what nobody likes?

1118
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,460
Nobody likes a showoff.

1119
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,170
Hello.

1120
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,330
Yeah, he's here.

1121
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,170
Okay. Thank you.

1122
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,100
Files are in conference room C.

1123
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,910
Why wouldn't they bring them
to my cubicle?

1124
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,980
They're trying to bury you
in paperwork.

1125
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,850
Well, they picked
the wrong guy.

1126
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,580
If they didn't, I did.

1127
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,020
Get it done
by the end of the week.

1128
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,220
I got to run
and charm our new client.

1129
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,730
Nice to finally meet you.

1130
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,800
Jessica says you're
gonna sweep me off my feet.

1131
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,930
I'll do my best, Mr. Dockery.

1132
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,130
You got a nice serve there.

1133
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,670
Working on it.

1134
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,770
What the hell is this?

1135
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,670
It's you having sex
with a woman

1136
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,610
who isn't Mrs. Dockery.

1137
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,180
Are you trying to blackmail me?

1138
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,810
You asked my firm
where you're vulnerable

1139
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,980
to corporate takeover.

1140
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,650
That's it right there.

1141
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:01,710
What are you pulling here?

1142
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,220
Your wife owns 10%

1143
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,150
of the company's voting shares.

1144
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,790
You've been seeing this woman
and several others

1145
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,290
for quite some time.

1146
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,920
How do you think
your wife's gonna vote

1147
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,390
after she finds out?
Who says she has to find out?

1148
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,000
My investigator got these
within a week.

1149
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,600
What do you think
a motivated competitor's

1150
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,430
gonna dig up in a year?

1151
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,100
I have a solution.

1152
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,010
Trade her your preferred shares,

1153
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,370
which have no voting rights,

1154
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,410
for her common shares,
which do.

1155
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,810
The preferred shares
are worth $2 million more.

1156
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,150
A fraction of what you'll lose

1157
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,850
if you get voted
out of your company.

1158
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,280
John, I don't care if you sleep

1159
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,780
with every woman
in the Hamptons.

1160
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,980
Just give her
the preferred shares.

1161
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,320
Jessica said you were gonna
charm me to get my business.

1162
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,090
I'm not interested
in getting your business.

1163
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,660
I'm interested in keeping it.

1164
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,800
I know where
they don't want us to look.

1165
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,330
Did you get through
all those files in one night?

1166
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,730
I would have done it faster,

1167
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,500
but I ordered a pizza.

1168
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,570
Speaking of which,
have you ever had

1169
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,170
the cheese in the crust?

1170
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,110
Because it blew my mind.
What'd you find?

1171
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,110
There was a dismissal
on march 12th, 2005.

1172
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,410
But the file with the employee
name on it is missing.

1173
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,010
It's our woman. I know it is.

1174
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,010
I'm moving to slap sanctions

1175
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,780
on their attorney,
possible jail time.

1176
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,550
Guy's not gonna know
what hit him.

1177
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,320
Dennis, it's Harvey Specter.

1178
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,190
Did you have anything to do
with the march 12, 2005 files

1179
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,360
left out of discovery?

1180
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,700
If they're here by noon,
I'll believe you.

1181
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,900
If not,
we're filing for sanctions.

1182
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,300
Threat of sanctions is better
than filing for sanctions.

1183
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,140
That's what I meant.
Threaten, not file.

1184
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,210
Who would mean that?

1185
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,510
Shave.

1186
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,580
Have you ever heard
of this woman?

1187
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:43,910
Joanna Webster?

1188
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,610
No. Why?

1189
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,080
The company's trying
to hide her from us.

1190
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,820
You think Hunt did
the same thing to her

1191
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,420
that he did to me? Yes.

1192
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,190
Then you have to make her
come forward and say so.

1193
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,620
Yeah. That's the plan.

1194
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,190
Thank you.

1195
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,840
Joanna Webster?

1196
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,170
Can I help you?

1197
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,540
Hi. My name's Mike Ross.

1198
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,770
I'm a... I'm a lawyer.

1199
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,410
I have some questions for you

1200
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,550
about your time
at Devlin McGreggor.

1201
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,550
Please. Look, just let me
tell you a story

1202
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,650
about my client, okay?

1203
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,090
Fine. Just a second.

1204
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,590
Mr. Ross,

1205
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,090
what happened to me
happened six years ago.

1206
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,720
It was horrible,

1207
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,130
and there was a reason
I didn't do anything

1208
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,260
about it.

1209
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,800
They'll put me on that stand

1210
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,000
and attack me,
and I don't want that.

1211
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,000
Ms. Webster, Joanna,

1212
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,570
this man is a predator,

1213
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,710
and if you don't help stop him,
he will do it again.

1214
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,380
All you have to do
is give a deposition.

1215
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,110
I'm sorry.

1216
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,850
I can't do it.

1217
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,660
What happened with the witness?

1218
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,970
Uh, I failed...

1219
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,170
To not be awesome.

1220
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,600
I got her to testify!

1221
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,740
You should have seen me.
I tried everything.

1222
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,510
He'd do it again,

1223
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,780
I'd be with her every step
of the way...

1224
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,850
Nothing worked.

1225
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,580
And then it hit me.

1226
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,850
I asked her
what if it was her daughter

1227
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,490
that he did this to.

1228
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,520
She melted.

1229
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,590
And you know how I came up
with that little gem?

1230
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,770
I cared about her. Oh.

1231
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,530
Yeah.

1232
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,470
Thank you.

1233
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,970
I'm glad to see
that staying up all night

1234
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,070
doesn't make you act
like a complete idiot.

1235
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,770
Go home and get some sleep.

1236
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,110
I don't want you waving
that thing around

1237
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,380
during tomorrow's deposition.

1238
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,750
Harvey.

1239
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,150
How's the pro Bono going?

1240
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,890
Great. I just talked a witness
into testifying.

1241
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,990
Really?
What's the witness's name?

1242
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,030
I'm not an idiot.

1243
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,560
Don't treat me like one.

1244
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,370
You pawned off the case.

1245
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,040
Jessica,
I've got higher profile cases...

1246
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,240
Need I remind you
that when we first met,

1247
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,010
you were a screw-up?

1248
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,840
I gave you a shot
at the mail room,

1249
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,280
led you up the ranks, and then
paid for you to go to Harvard,

1250
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,320
where, by the way,
you jerked off the entire time

1251
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,390
you were there,
and I still hired you.

1252
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,460
And you've benefited
from that ever since.

1253
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,390
Look, I closed the Dockery case,
okay.

1254
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,330
You made a promise to me.

1255
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:41,930
You broke it, and then you lied
to my face.

1256
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.

1257
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,630
This is personal.

1258
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,370
And I'll tell you
something else.

1259
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,410
You made your bed,
you better goddamn win.

1260
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,420
God damn it.

1261
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,300
What the hell is wrong with you?
I need the briefcase back.

1262
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,840
Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?

1263
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,910
You don't care
about our friendship at all.

1264
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,540
You're my oldest friend,
and you know it.

1265
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,780
But you don't seem
to care about that anymore,

1266
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,380
and, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.

1267
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,110
And I'm gonna find it, Mike.

1268
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,620
Well, I ditched it
when I was running away

1269
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,590
from the cops
that you sent me into.

1270
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,610
Mike.

1271
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,280
Where you going?

1272
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,720
To my cubicle.

1273
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,750
No, you're not.
It's pee in a cup time.

1274
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,260
I'm sorry. What?

1275
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,690
Drug test. Follow me.

1276
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm just gonna put my stuff
back...

1277
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,730
now.

1278
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,880
Oh, by the way, my cousin
was your year at Harvard.

1279
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:33,110
And I asked him if he knew you.

1280
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,550
It's so funny. He didn't.

1281
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,880
Well, what's his name?

1282
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,180
Mitch samberg.

1283
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,920
Yeah. Don't know him.

1284
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,560
It's a big school.

1285
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,620
Not really.

1286
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,390
We get 7,000 applications
a year.

1287
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,700
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

1288
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,700
Oh, Mitchell.

1289
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,200
With the slicked back hair,

1290
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,700
graduated seventh in the class.

1291
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,800
Sure. Yeah. I remember him.

1292
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,110
Time to face the music.

1293
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,450
I got to get
to the Kendrick filing.

1294
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:08,610
Where the hell is Mike?

1295
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,380
I don't know.

1296
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,390
Leave the cup on the counter.

1297
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:20,260
You'll have to leave that
out here.

1298
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,700
Why?
If you take it in there

1299
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,000
with you, I have to check
to make sure you don't have

1300
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,200
another urine sample in it.

1301
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,680
Where you been?
Hi. Um...

1302
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,210
Getting drug tested, actually.

1303
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,880
The deposition's
this afternoon.

1304
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,750
Before they get here, I want you
to grill this woman

1305
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,220
about her background
for anything they might use

1306
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,420
against her.

1307
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:22,190
You got it? Got it.

1308
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,720
Make her tell you everything.
Everything.

1309
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,820
Everything.
Everything.

1310
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,690
Okay.
Okay.

1311
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,500
I had been working six months

1312
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,340
when Mr. Hunt started asking me
to work more,

1313
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,210
order dinner.

1314
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,920
One night, late, he tried
to have sex with me.

1315
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,890
The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.

1316
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:55,590
Two months later I was fired
for having a bad attitude.

1317
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,190
This is ridiculous.

1318
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,860
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1319
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,360
You're not even supposed
to be here.

1320
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,030
Mr. Hunt has every right
to be here.

1321
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:08,300
Now, Ms. Webster, after working
for Devlin McGreggor,

1322
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,970
you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?

1323
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,970
Yes, I did.
A place that advertises

1324
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,410
the sexuality
of its waitstaff, correct?

1325
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,680
You will have to ask them that.

1326
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,610
I'm asking you.

1327
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,780
And she's not answering.
Move on.

1328
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:30,120
Ms. Webster, would you say
that you're a truthful person?

1329
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,730
Yes.

1330
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,400
So when you said earlier
that you had never been arrested

1331
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,570
for a crime, you were speaking
the truth?

1332
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:41,940
Yes.
Yes, so in 1993 then

1333
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,770
you were not arrested for
stealing $1,000 worth of jewelry

1334
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,080
from the willow grove mall
in Pennsylvania?

1335
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,480
I was 17. That was one mistake.

1336
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,580
Those records were supposed
to be sealed.

1337
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,550
So when you say
those records were sealed,

1338
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,020
what you mean to say
is you thought

1339
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,050
you could get away with a lie?

1340
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,760
No, that's not it.

1341
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,760
You're making it seem
different that it is.

1342
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,530
I'm sorry.
You were arrested in your past

1343
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,260
and you lied about it here
under oath.

1344
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,360
Is that
making it seem different

1345
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,270
than what it is?

1346
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,210
No answer. Hmm, all right.

1347
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,840
Let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,

1348
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,580
what's to make us believe
you're not lying about Mr. Hunt?

1349
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,490
How the hell did you miss
that arrest?

1350
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,630
I did every background check
we have.

1351
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,800
Did you grill her
like I told you to?

1352
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,430
It was a sealed record, Harvey!

1353
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,430
Goddamn it, I knew it.

1354
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,230
Fix it.

1355
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,170
Joanna! Wait. Please!

1356
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,910
This is why I didn't want
to testify.

1357
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,440
They twist something
from 100 years ago

1358
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,710
and make me look like a liar.

1359
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,880
They make it sound
like what he did

1360
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,480
to me didn't happen.

1361
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,010
It doesn't matter. All right?

1362
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,410
I just... I need you
to testify on Friday

1363
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,250
and keep this case alive.

1364
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,950
We don't have time to find
anyone else before...

1365
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,220
would you please wait?

1366
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,020
No. I'm not waiting.

1367
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,490
You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.

1368
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,990
You never told me
you were arrested.

1369
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,730
Don't contact me again, please.

1370
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,260
What happened with the witness?

1371
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:58,200
Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.

1372
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:01,170
So you're going to quit?

1373
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,570
It's either that
or have Louis Litt fire me.

1374
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,110
What are you talking about?

1375
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,350
My first day,
Louis fired Gary Lipsky

1376
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,010
for screwing up a case.

1377
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,650
He said if I did the same thing

1378
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,750
I'd be gone just as fast.

1379
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,120
Well, you go back
to the witness' house

1380
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,890
and you get her
to testify again.

1381
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,820
I tried. There's no way.
There's always a way.

1382
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,320
Then why don't you go
and convince her?

1383
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,060
Because you screwed it up.

1384
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:23,160
Oh, and you don't give
a damn about the client. Right.

1385
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,970
That's not my job.
Does your job

1386
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,370
include giving a damn about me?

1387
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,970
Because the least
you could do is offer

1388
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,640
to stand up to Louis for me.
Stand up for you?

1389
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,010
I put my ass
on the line for you,

1390
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:32,510
but it turns out
you may have had the balls

1391
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,480
to get this job,
but you don't have the courage

1392
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,180
to stick it out
when it gets tough.

1393
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,610
That's not true.
Isn't it?

1394
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,310
You've had one foot
out the door

1395
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,150
since you got here.
What are you talking about?

1396
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,480
I'm talking
about that briefcase

1397
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,190
being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.

1398
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,150
And I know what it is.

1399
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,490
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.

1400
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,320
You can make some quick cash
and go right back

1401
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,630
to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.

1402
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:55,360
So if you want to quit,
go ahead.

1403
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:58,330
But this isn't because of Louis,
and it isn't because of me.

1404
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,930
It's because you're afraid
you might have to admit

1405
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,170
that you're not
as smart as you think you are.

1406
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,710
If you're here in the morning,

1407
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,510
I'll know
I still have an associate.

1408
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,600
Hey, I get that you were upset

1409
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,230
that I was promoted before you,

1410
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,600
but if you ever threaten to fire
one of my guys again,

1411
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,040
I am going to kick your ass.

1412
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,480
Hmm.
What are you talking about?

1413
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,340
Don't play dumb with me,
all right?

1414
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:19,450
You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.

1415
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,150
What's so funny?

1416
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,520
Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.

1417
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:28,690
What?
I didn't fire anyone.

1418
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,890
That's how I let
the new associates know

1419
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,790
what's expected of them.

1420
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,700
You plant a fake employee
to manipulate the assoc...

1421
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,930
that's it.

1422
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,130
What?

1423
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,430
Michael.

1424
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,000
I want to quit.

1425
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:13,270
Come here.

1426
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,550
When your parents died,

1427
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,150
I lost
my son and my daughter-in-law.

1428
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:35,090
I was scared, alone,
and I was too old to raise you.

1429
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,000
But I had no choice.

1430
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:42,800
Because who else was going
to care of my grandson?

1431
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:46,570
You made me a promise before.

1432
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,010
You're in the door.

1433
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,780
Promise me now the only way
you'll leave

1434
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,150
is if they rip you out.

1435
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,770
You can save your breath.

1436
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:10,930
There's no way I'm testifying

1437
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,670
at the hearing tomorrow.

1438
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,240
That's not why I'm here.

1439
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,570
I know what you did.
What are you talking about?

1440
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,740
You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor,

1441
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,880
and you were never harassed
by Mr. Hunt.

1442
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,840
That's a I...
Now I could tell you

1443
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,150
that I've got the canceled
checks or the wire transfer

1444
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,020
or whatever smoking gun
that exists... I don't.

1445
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,520
But I will. And when I do,

1446
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,080
you'll be going to jail
unless you tell me

1447
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,520
what happened right now.

1448
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,360
I'm the guy you tell.

1449
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,360
All I had to do was waste
your time until tomorrow

1450
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,230
after the hearing.

1451
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,270
Please,
I just needed the money.

1452
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,570
I don't want to go to jail.

1453
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,340
Here's what you're gonna do...

1454
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,280
Did you call this place before?

1455
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,050
Mike!

1456
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,150
Hey.
I'm not giving this to you

1457
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,920
because you need it.

1458
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,990
I'm giving it to you
because I don't.

1459
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,490
And I don't know if I'm ready
to forgive you yet or not,

1460
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,160
but I do know we're even.

1461
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:15,960
Wait a second.

1462
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,170
I...

1463
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,040
Well...

1464
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,380
Don't.

1465
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,410
Now we're even.

1466
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,420
Huh.

1467
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:54,300
I see you came to work today.
Nice suit.

1468
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,940
It was a barter transaction.

1469
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,970
I got six of them
for one little briefcase.

1470
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,680
Listen...

1471
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,680
I'm sorry and...

1472
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,350
Forget it.

1473
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:15,190
When I first started,
Jessica rode me so hard...

1474
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,190
I quit once a month.

1475
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,190
I just told you
what you needed to hear.

1476
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:23,200
That's just it.
I've only ever had one person

1477
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,970
who told me
what I needed to hear.

1478
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:30,100
Maybe it's time I started
trusting somebody else.

1479
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,650
Merry Christmas.

1480
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,580
Is this for real?

1481
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:50,290
You know what to do.

1482
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:54,090
Press until it hurts.

1483
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:58,760
Wire transfer from your
account to Joanna Webster's,

1484
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,200
phone records
with Joanna Webster

1485
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,570
prior to her testimony,

1486
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,170
and an affidavit stating
you paid Ms. Webster

1487
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,070
to falsely testify.

1488
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:12,780
Mr. Hunt, harassment
is a civil violation.

1489
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,180
The penalty is money.

1490
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,250
But witness tampering,
that's a crime,

1491
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,750
and you will go to prison,

1492
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,080
where I guarantee you'll learn

1493
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,920
more about unwanted
sexual advances

1494
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,790
than you can possibly imagine.

1495
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,260
Do you think
this is going to intimidate me?

1496
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,390
Even if this evidence
was credible,

1497
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,830
who are you going to get
to prosecute

1498
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,760
a small-time
witness tampering charge, huh?

1499
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:35,300
Harvey, didn't you graduate
law school

1500
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:37,470
with the current
U.S. attorney in New York?

1501
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,200
In fact, I did.

1502
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,770
And I think
he might even be interested

1503
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,140
in pursuing a case like this.

1504
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,610
Wait, are you two still close?

1505
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,240
Well, I was the best man
at his wedding.

1506
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,780
Wow.
No, you weren't.

1507
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,110
You're bluffing.

1508
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,550
No.

1509
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,020
I think I've got
some pictures...

1510
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,850
Of us at the ceremony.

1511
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,820
Let's see.

1512
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,250
Yeah. Here we are.

1513
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,290
You must admit,
I look very dashing.

1514
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,560
This is me and his mother.

1515
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,030
The woman adores me.

1516
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:05,630
Here we are
at his bachelor party.

1517
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,100
There's no strippers.
It was lame.

1518
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,600
But he can't put guys like you
away for sexual harassment

1519
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,500
and then go to strip clubs,
now, can he?

1520
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,100
All right. What do you want?

1521
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,640
An admission of guilt
and a guarantee

1522
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,280
that you'll obtain treatment
before working again.

1523
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,780
And Nancy gets reinstated
with back pay.

1524
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:26,620
Fine.
And a raise.

1525
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,690
Okay. All right.

1526
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,420
Are we done?

1527
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:32,120
The kid should be able
to grow up without the burden

1528
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,920
of tuition hanging over
his head, don't you think?

1529
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:35,090
Which is why
you're also gonna pay Nancy

1530
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,430
an extra $250,000.

1531
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,900
Charles.

1532
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,300
Gentlemen.

1533
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:06,260
Thank you for everything.

1534
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,860
You're welcome.

1535
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,360
So just one question.

1536
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,530
Why'd you go to Joanna's house?

1537
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,360
Because I figured it out.

1538
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:13,830
I object.

1539
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,570
I think you did it
because you care.

1540
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,840
I did it because it's my job.

1541
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,910
Would you admit it?
You care about me.

1542
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,270
I saw you smile when I showed up
for work this morning.

1543
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,210
I didn't smile.
I was thinking of a funny joke.

1544
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,050
Look,
we start on this tomorrow.

1545
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,420
Does this mean
we're officially a team now?

1546
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,520
I wouldn't move your things
into Wayne manor just yet.

1547
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:36,420
So now you're Batman?
Closer to him than Clemenza.

1548
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:39,560
Oh, yeah, kilmer.
Clooney.

1549
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,290
Keaton.

1550
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,330
Did you really quit
when you first started?

1551
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,899
Of course not. I'm not a wuss.                                       .
