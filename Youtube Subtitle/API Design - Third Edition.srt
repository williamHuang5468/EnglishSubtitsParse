18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:52,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Donna moment talks a lot about design</font>

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:55,260
and there's a particular article he uses

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,460
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the differences between</font>

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,469
simplicity and features you know we

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">always get pounded with hey we need more</font>

23
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:06,130
features while we need to keep it more

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,750
simple and he has a quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that I</font>

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,380
really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says the issue isn't</font>

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,490
about simplicity is about design so as

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,800
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through this today we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some pointers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how you can</font>

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,740
take what's normally pretty complex and

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,480
add that usability to look forward at

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,740
the end developer as well so if you

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it it's more like like</font>

33
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're building a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cathedral right</font>

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">which has so much complexity but to the</font>

35
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,950
people walk you through there to the

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,470
users it has to be beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

37
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,390
our goal on the agenda today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

38
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a recap of previous editions of</font>

39
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,770
this API design presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd have</font>

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought a little bit about epi modeling</font>

41
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,450
how that can help you and your team

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting some issues around security or</font>

43
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,140
some methods for for implementing

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,900
security new API talk a little bit about

45
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,330
message design get into some benefits of

46
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,120
hypermedia and talk a little bit about

47
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,040
modeling transactions so the design

48
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,080
materials that we've covered in the past

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,910
in the the first two editions of this

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,240
webcast are also available in an e-book

51
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,160
called Web API design like McDonald's

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,840
has served billions of burgers over

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,010
10,000 people have downloaded this

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,739
design book

55
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,349
and it's our intention to base the next

56
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:19,079
edition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the API design book on the on</font>

57
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:22,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> webcast that we're doing today as</font>

58
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:24,430
Kevin<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned in the past we focused</font>

59
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,079
on some aspects of API design which are

60
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,269
we've recapped on this cheat sheet here

61
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,010
if you really look at the previous

62
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,049
editions of this of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this content we</font>

63
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,629
really focused on you are I design that

64
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,470
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heart of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter and we</font>

65
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,810
hinted that some things around

66
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,909
versioning errors and some client

67
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,420
considerations so what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

68
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,400
today is is go beyond these topics and

69
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,780
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things like designing your</font>

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,549
messages especially the response

71
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,720
messages and then take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some</font>

72
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:53,049
other things like what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening with</font>

73
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,060
with hypermedia great so how do you

74
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,670
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our API so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

75
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,920
about API modeling and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font>

76
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,349
have questions around that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we</font>

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,970
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> too deep into what we can do with</font>

78
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,560
some of these responses and then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

79
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,930
these different methodologies we can

80
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,090
take on just want to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a moment</font>

81
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,000
talking about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> API modeling really</font>

82
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,090
is and in the software world with we do

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,280
modeling all the time this is really

84
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,530
using those same concepts except

85
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,389
applying it to your API so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

86
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,680
advise folks to to collaborate with all

87
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:25,599
the stakeholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved that's</font>

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,310
marketing business analyst software

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,639
engineers key business people these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

90
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your epit most likely develop a</font>

91
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,709
language that everyone understands and

92
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:39,340
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> language in building your</font>

93
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:42,099
resources building out the parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

94
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really key to keeping</font>

95
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,900
everyone on the same page and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

96
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,989
document how you do that is up to you

97
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,459
write a lot of folks use UML some people

98
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,410
have their own version of you know

99
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,060
modeling language that they use that's

100
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,900
that's fine whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're comfortable</font>

101
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,329
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then continue to iterate the</font>

102
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,639
key point here is don't go off on your

103
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,049
own right is as soon as you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

104
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,599
what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve this for the</font>

105
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,609
company all by<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself you'll put in</font>

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,709
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hours of work only realize</font>

107
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:14,680
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey marketing doesn't really use</font>

108
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,630
this term that way or this really isn't

109
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,550
the direction

110
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,230
want to go with our resources in our API

111
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:23,820
so deftly include that API team they're

112
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,560
really important part so security I know

113
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,970
through some of our FG webcast you're

114
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,290
talking about security before we're

115
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch on it again because it's</font>

116
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,060
a pretty important thing the Twitter API

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,860
uses in for their streaming API anyway

118
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,830
they have the option<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using HTTP basic</font>

119
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,720
authentication which is essentially a

120
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,010
username<font color="#CCCCCC"> and password base64</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encoded</font>

121
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,820
that's that's one way to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sure</font>

122
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,340
amazon decided to roll their own

123
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,750
authorization their own authentication

124
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,200
so they built on top of HTTP

125
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,560
authorization and they have this AWS

126
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,120
authorization type Google is using OAuth

127
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,360
specifically they're using OAuth 2 point

128
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,200
0 and bearer tokens our recommendation

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to go the google route use OAuth 2</font>

130
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,540
HTTP basic is only so secure lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

131
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks are moving away from it and</font>

132
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing your own is a huge hassle you</font>

133
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,550
don't have typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have the</font>

134
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,440
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security resources to</font>

135
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,560
verify that our design is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is perfect in</font>

136
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,690
is it's rock solid Oh off has been

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,940
through the paces quite a bit and there

138
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,940
are even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure options coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

139
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,260
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> for access tokens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

140
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,700
so when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach message design</font>

141
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,120
that's one of the key topics that we

142
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,710
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover today and we're going to</font>

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,710
do that started out pretty simple here

144
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,060
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all regardless of how you</font>

145
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,620
design the messages you have to answer

146
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,440
what kind of format you want it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

147
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's our strong suggestion that you</font>

148
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,830
support both JSON and XML there are

149
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,030
folks who have libraries that do great

150
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,590
stuff with accent mother be loved and

151
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are folks who can't stand XML have</font>

152
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,010
great libraries that do stuff with<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON</font>

153
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,420
that they love unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really</font>

154
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,300
strong business requirements or

155
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,370
objectives that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will limit you to XML or</font>

156
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,530
JSON you ought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just support both and</font>

157
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,990
if you're not sure about which one to

158
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,970
make the default pic JSON if you know

159
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be XML go ahead and make it XML</font>

160
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,470
but you're not sure our<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion is to</font>

161
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,500
make your default JSON now<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

162
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,900
talk about how you model in your in your

163
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,220
response message both<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single item like</font>

164
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,870
a single resource and also will

165
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,510
clutching of resources and we're going

166
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,210
to do that by taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at how</font>

167
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,730
three big public api's do it what you

168
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,670
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is a response from Twitter</font>

169
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,890
Foursquare and Instagram for each of the

170
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,360
primary objects from those systems so

171
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,160
for example in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter you're looking at</font>

172
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,720
a tweet in Foursquare you're looking at

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,660
the check-in and Instagram you're

174
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,740
looking at a media or an image and what

175
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,990
we do here is what we're looking at is

176
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each of these so</font>

177
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,000
you see twitter is pretty verbose at the

178
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,740
top level<font color="#CCCCCC"> four square has included meta</font>

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,110
notifications and response and instagram

180
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,010
has included meta and data now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

181
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,720
side we're going to do a double<font color="#E5E5E5"> click</font>

182
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,910
down on both Foursquare Instagram to see

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,830
what they reveal beneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so what</font>

184
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,180
we've done is a single single click down

185
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,040
on Instagram so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing what's</font>

186
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,530
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> there meta attribute and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

187
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,390
force where we had just click twice once

188
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,740
we clicked on response and then that's a

189
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,720
check in and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> opened up check in</font>

190
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,720
so what you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real real</font>

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,070
core object is represented at the heart

192
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,390
of each of these in the case of some

193
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,790
objects there are more verbose than

194
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,290
others it's question is what is written

195
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,010
for us to learn from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in terms of</font>

196
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,450
how we go about designing our primary

197
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,210
resource and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think you</font>

198
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,550
ought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do include a property for meta</font>

199
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,550
where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in meta information</font>

200
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,560
about the object and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then include the</font>

201
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,440
actual name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the object type itself as</font>

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> primary where area where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

203
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,890
the data to contrast that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna</font>

204
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back one slide quickly here if you</font>

205
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,140
contrast that foursquare put their

206
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,520
information under response and then

207
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,840
under checking so I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact they</font>

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,460
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> check-in but I don't like the fact</font>

209
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,260
that they buried under response because

210
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,210
you've already separated the response

211
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,220
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the metadata by having</font>

212
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,360
a meditech there and Instagram they just

213
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,710
call it data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of really</font>

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,140
annoying I think both to me and Kevin

215
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,930
yeah it's just kind of a throwaway word

216
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,640
so we like the idea having the dog there

217
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,610
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clever what</font>

218
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,960
Foursquare has done with notifications

219
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,550
because you can imagine every response

220
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,410
that you get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the API there</font>

221
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,540
might be some global state or global

222
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,130
information that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed that you</font>

223
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,660
could also you know take advantage of

224
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,670
kind of piggyback in that information on

225
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,260
the API response so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can surely clara</font>

226
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,540
that they've included notifications in

227
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,530
in the response so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know how</font>

228
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">that translates is foremost app</font>

229
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,839
developers who are using this

230
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah they go okay both the notifications</font>

231
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,539
coming back every time with every

232
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,849
response i can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and include that</font>

233
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,680
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that information so i can</font>

234
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,960
throw stuff you know at the top of the

235
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen or somewhere interesting in my</font>

236
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,339
app so that's our guidance on doing the

237
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,720
resource kind of take the best of<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

238
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,140
worlds from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Foursquare and Instagram and</font>

239
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,670
use a meta meta data area<font color="#E5E5E5"> name your</font>

240
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,140
primary resource and then include

241
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,210
notifications or other global

242
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,440
information if that makes sense so

243
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,230
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> single that's a single</font>

244
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">resource now how do we represent</font>

245
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,080
collections of resources this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

246
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,520
case we have more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so we're</font>

247
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,500
gonna take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at this again now what</font>

248
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,300
you'll see here is a Twitter Foursquare

249
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,870
and Instagram they all do pretty much

250
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same thing which is throwing the</font>

251
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">objects into an array of multiple</font>

252
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,620
objects and with one minor exception

253
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,260
this is an important point Twitter

254
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,150
Foursquare and Instagram all include the

255
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,010
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact information in the collection</font>

256
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,660
that they do in this single so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

257
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,089
you're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you make this</font>

258
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision for your API as Kevin and I</font>

259
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,460
were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both of</font>

260
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,440
our inclination was well what you really

261
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,630
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is provide a limited subset</font>

262
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,740
of the data in the collection and then

263
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,839
when you want to drill down it then you

264
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,339
provide the poor bigger verbose thing

265
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,800
with the idea that you're going to

266
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">preserve on bandwidth but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I at least</font>

267
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,470
meeting I know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you won't go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

268
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> warm up to the idea of including</font>

269
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same exact information in both of</font>

270
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,860
the collection and in the single in the

271
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,200
single response just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's a</font>

272
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,520
sense of predictability there and it

273
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,320
seems more deterministic and you count

274
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,940
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it being there the one exception that</font>

275
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,980
i mentioned is actually Foursquare

276
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,459
includes one extra property called

277
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,630
source the standalone resource they

278
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,310
don't include on the collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

279
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">really sure what the what the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

280
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one was so you can pair other stuff</font>

281
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,900
together my feeling is do the same thing

282
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,640
make sure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> include that metadata</font>

283
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,080
include your notifications or other

284
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,300
global information that impact the app

285
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you know put in the nice</font>

286
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,380
portable version of the primary resource

287
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,180
in this case it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be dogs for our</font>

288
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeling include all that same</font>

289
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,480
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that would be</font>

290
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">included in a single resource and you're</font>

291
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,839
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you have a</font>

292
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,339
ridiculous model where the single

293
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,020
resource is super huge and you are

294
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,760
worried about bandwidth then you can

295
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,019
kind of trim down the one that goes in

296
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font>

297
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,819
and although Kevin doesn't always agree

298
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,170
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can use partial selection to</font>

299
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,550
help you narrow that down as well and

300
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,279
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous versions of</font>

301
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,739
this talk professional selections so to

302
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,879
do search results this is an important

303
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:58,279
point this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a quote from the</font>

304
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,139
Facebook API documentation selecting

305
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,639
results is not the same as searching and

306
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,459
sometimes it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> over-exaggerate</font>

307
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,689
why these are separate activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

308
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,459
essentially the idea of searching is you

309
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:09,709
can create a just some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of natural</font>

310
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:12,350
language string in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> query box and it</font>

311
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,059
can search across resource types so

312
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,769
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> limiting to say select like</font>

313
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,379
hey giving all the photos you're saying

314
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,029
generally give me anything about fubar

315
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,649
and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results across all the</font>

316
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,420
resource types so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

317
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,079
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how three api's approach this</font>

318
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,110
this is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> their search api</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

319
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">custom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> search and read it for searching</font>

320
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,629
their listings and without taking a lot

321
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:36,889
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to drill into the details of</font>

322
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,689
what is coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the response</font>

323
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,449
design here just keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that there</font>

324
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:43,339
is metadata about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results there's</font>

325
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,619
another data about the query and then

326
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:47,299
there's the actual data itself that is

327
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:49,100
being we is being returned from the

328
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:50,089
search so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overwhelming you'd</font>

329
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,619
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> would start digging into this to</font>

330
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,089
figure out which stuff should you

331
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,619
include in the search response in which

332
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,809
stuff should you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so here's</font>

333
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:58,490
our suggestion for the most part follow

334
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:00,079
Google custom search they do really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

335
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,879
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this well we did those we took</font>

336
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,579
the key pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of metadata that they</font>

337
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,679
included we just they put it under<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

338
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,350
different couple of nested objects we

339
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,420
just consolidated all under one metadata

340
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,299
property so here we're saying include

341
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,249
the limit and offset for the pagination

342
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,990
include the total results that are

343
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:19,699
available because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how do you want</font>

344
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,410
to do pagination in a family way and

345
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:24,470
important to include the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> query</font>

346
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,519
string that that was sent to make the

347
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,290
crew happen and then if you want to show

348
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,610
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> how fast your search</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engine is you</font>

349
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,860
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and conclude the search time</font>

350
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,449
then of course in the results property

351
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,419
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the actual array of all the</font>

352
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,790
results that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came back from the search</font>

353
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,720
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> best that on the next one now we're</font>

354
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,610
switching gears here how do you

355
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,709
represent links inside the response sure

356
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">cell links links are queues inside of</font>

357
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:51,100
your message that point so different

358
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,330
right so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the netflix API</font>

359
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,620
they're using something called web

360
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,670
linking there's actually a spec around

361
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,830
this an RFC you can see an HR up there

362
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pointing to a URL where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

363
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,360
find what we're looking for you see of a

364
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,770
rel value there in that link and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

365
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,090
special meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that real value if</font>

366
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,170
you look at netflix if documentation

367
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,350
will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't person about</font>

368
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,090
actor is an actor in a film and a title

369
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,720
associated associated with that Elijah

370
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">would visit the github API that we're</font>

371
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,870
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more of a Netflix API when</font>

372
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,270
they were in beta but now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they've</font>

373
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,790
changed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a little bit under their</font>

374
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,860
organization is<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or so if you look</font>

375
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a repository of the 17 organization</font>

376
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,730
you find the organization ser el you

377
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,770
would go to that URL to get to that

378
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,630
particular resource our<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendation</font>

379
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,890
is to follow Netflix and the web looking

380
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,380
spec and a big part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because</font>

381
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,840
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification around that and</font>

382
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,460
you can point your developers to that to

383
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,000
understand how to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your API</font>

384
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,970
which is usually poor before it before

385
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,330
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links and you might even set it</font>

386
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,980
in went by pretty quickly how how do you

387
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,750
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> people understand if they should</font>

388
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,370
put links in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their response or not it's</font>

389
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">just you always do it you never do it</font>

390
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,670
certain times you do it what's the

391
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,360
listed that he restricts for me to use

392
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,310
links yeah so I mean links are really

393
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,490
helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for developers right so if</font>

394
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,080
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at a response message and</font>

395
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,860
you see that there's a relationship

396
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,780
there between say a film and an actor

397
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that message and</font>

398
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,310
continue on your exploration of that API

399
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,140
right I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself going back to the</font>

400
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,320
documentation less and less and just

401
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:32,060
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on I'll exploring that epi</font>

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:34,130
so that's one huge benefit yeah and i

403
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contrast is the alternative is</font>

404
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,090
you what you hear the word templating

405
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,920
thrown around a lot like instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

406
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,930
giving back the link you might just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

407
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">back the ID and a developer has to know</font>

408
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets plugged into the</font>

409
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,570
template in the right spot so in this

410
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,550
case coming back here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalog of</font>

411
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,870
people so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just saw the people i</font>

412
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,430
being that i would grab that ID and say

413
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,939
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to do a get on / people</font>

414
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">and drop the ID and</font>

415
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:57,479
at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest or that's sort of trade</font>

416
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,709
off right correct and that takes some

417
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:02,879
context switching if you're doing

418
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:05,129
explore exploratory work and takes you

419
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,089
know some different coding structures

420
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,859
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then to make sure that you do the</font>

421
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,299
ornate temples properly but yeah any

422
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:11,339
other kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is correlated this</font>

423
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,809
is all I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out of band if you</font>

424
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,069
don't include the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link in the response</font>

425
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,720
and the developers have to go a lot of

426
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:17,489
band you can go recent documentation or

427
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,409
something outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API to figure</font>

428
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:20,759
out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do next so right we all</font>

429
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:23,269
other context switching as a big cost

430
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US bank right happens cool beans</font>

431
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we'll move it how to represent</font>

432
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:30,449
actions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we do this Brian kept</font>

433
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,879
saying like is there a better definition

434
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:35,639
for this or what what our actions right

435
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,049
and actions are typically state

436
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,369
transitions coming off of that

437
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,609
particular resource that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

438
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:45,059
at so we can get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the examples</font>

439
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:46,619
here give up documents this so again we

440
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,269
see we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going away from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the message</font>

441
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're looking at documentation to</font>

442
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,470
figure out how to do this in this case

443
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:55,470
we're doing an update to a repository on

444
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,409
github when the documents you know the

445
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,819
HTTP method that you need to use your I

446
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:02,189
template you need to use and on the

447
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:04,169
input fields I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a good</font>

448
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:07,229
example of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wild in</font>

449
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:09,539
public API is but if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

450
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:10,829
four based API example it is taking

451
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:14,009
exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> gift up is doing and</font>

452
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,689
applying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> formed based</font>

453
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:18,269
meeting like HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> form so if you leave</font>

454
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:22,379
with HTML you know reform tag there's a

455
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:24,899
method there's a URL in there where you

456
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,419
can you know where you go to dad execute

457
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,409
that method and their list of fields so

458
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,779
we're recommending the<font color="#E5E5E5"> form based</font>

459
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:32,759
approach seeing this more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

460
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wild not not too many folks but i</font>

461
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,809
think it's it's something we need to

462
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:41,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep an eye on moving towards that form</font>

463
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:43,499
based approach allows a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

464
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,479
for instance hidden fields or a big

465
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:47,579
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use in HTML forms today we</font>

466
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:48,779
throw those into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> API right that</font>

467
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,309
means you have David coming back and

468
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,739
forth keeping that stateless nature to

469
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,970
your API and still getting what you need

470
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:57,239
on the server without affecting your

471
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,129
clients at all so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this come to</font>

472
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:01,409
life for me when this comes when that

473
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:03,449
when they actually comes back in my HTTP

474
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:05,209
response I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> my code is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go</font>

475
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,490
ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> parse this and then</font>

476
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,829
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm creating an HTML form or iOS</font>

477
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,020
form and Android form I'm an introspect

478
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,760
this all the properties here and build

479
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,709
my form based off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that exactly and</font>

480
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,209
then at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of post or that started</font>

481
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,159
the method<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is telling me patch in</font>

482
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,049
this case is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

483
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:22,250
href so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I were building HTML form</font>

484
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,600
that's obvious it's going to go there

485
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,779
and I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS it's going to be an</font>

486
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:31,130
API call with that data correct cool got

487
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:33,080
it how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we represent metadata so we</font>

488
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,020
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple examples here flickr</font>

489
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,750
include some metadata in line with their

490
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,789
items in this case it's a photo<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

491
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,730
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of metadata there but</font>

492
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:45,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some exists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox they</font>

493
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,960
decided to have an entire metadata

494
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:53,659
resource to access so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

495
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,940
look at a file itself or a folder<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

496
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropbox there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data associated</font>

497
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,270
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's the path if it's you</font>

498
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,880
know how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> bikes are there all sorts</font>

499
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,159
of things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we like having</font>

500
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,919
metadata in the response itself and

501
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,750
we'll move usually favor that but there

502
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,510
are cases to consider you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know having</font>

503
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,270
that meta resource and again that's when

504
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">your your metadata become so significant</font>

505
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,450
that it actually should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeled on</font>

506
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,710
your API so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this makes a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

507
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,330
sense for dropbox that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

508
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,710
sense for for flipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should have</font>

509
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,210
talked it all over but you know some

510
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of meta hitting interesting but</font>

511
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,350
it's good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that in time so you</font>

512
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">know as we're talking everything we've</font>

513
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,500
been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about for the vestry</font>

514
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,020
ministers around designing the message

515
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> response message the message design a</font>

516
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,210
lot of what hypermedia thinking does is

517
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,649
address the message design so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

518
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:45,740
we learn from other media types so Adam

519
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:47,510
Adam<font color="#CCCCCC"> public one of the wheelie one of</font>

520
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,929
the first media types out there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

521
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:54,169
used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's its attention was for</font>

522
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:56,029
feeds and editing you know articles<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

523
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:58,659
the list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

524
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:02,120
important thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they showed us is</font>

525
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:04,549
to build a protocol around link

526
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,970
relations if you see if that link rel

527
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:09,590
equals at it should be in bold they're

528
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they're using that standard link</font>

529
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">role</font>

530
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,550
type to communicate to the developer or

531
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,490
the client that's consuming this this

532
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:20,520
API where to go to edit this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

533
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,740
resource I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this this too</font>

534
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,600
much but XHTML this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lady dies</font>

535
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,180
rights for urs that's not what's going

536
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here so the cool thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XHTML is</font>

537
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,950
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid XML which means that</font>

538
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,540
partial errs like it quite a bit have a

539
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,430
difficult to build HTML parser because

540
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,110
they kind of allow quite a bit going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

541
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:42,720
in there whereas xml is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

542
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:44,460
formed so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from psycho our status</font>

543
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're implementing an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alp</font>

544
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,620
specification that you can find out

545
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,650
there on the internet and helps has

546
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:56,850
certain meaning around classes such as

547
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:59,130
avatars users userlist<font color="#E5E5E5"> search you can</font>

548
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,790
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in XHTML we're including that</font>

549
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:06,809
in there and you really get that that

550
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:09,030
semantic connection so some people might

551
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,100
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a weird use of XHTML but you</font>

552
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,080
know it exists it's out there and

553
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,370
there's a there's a gentleman on the API

554
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,470
craft who's really been pretty active

555
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,020
about pushing a system index HTML as a

556
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:25,610
standard right it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

557
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:29,490
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now we have a few Jason based</font>

558
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:33,120
hypermedia types this one's how how is

559
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,970
is really student towards augmenting

560
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,390
your existing API so if you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason</font>

561
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,940
message out there adding this underscore

562
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,980
links to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing Jason message</font>

563
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,050
which will hopefully not collide with

564
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,630
any with an existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> underscore links</font>

565
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,920
property you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your j subject can</font>

566
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,490
start adding some of those hypermedia

567
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,929
elements here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see the link relation</font>

568
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,460
becomes like a key in this key value

569
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,679
pair inside the links object so we have

570
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,809
a link to self next and previous

571
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,500
iterating through orders in the

572
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,090
collection so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

573
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,710
options for augmenting your existing API

574
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,710
without breaking clients

575
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,220
collection plus jason is a media type

576
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,320
out there that is trying to model<font color="#CCCCCC"> adam</font>

577
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,540
pub and what they were doing except in

578
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,810
Jason so it's you know a little more

579
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,180
palatable to to some folks it also

580
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,850
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for extensions and in it you can</font>

581
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that there are queries that are</font>

582
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,820
modeled here but there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

583
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,910
templates that you can use so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sitting</font>

584
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:39,030
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those actions and allowing</font>

585
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:42,510
actually editing the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

586
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:46,080
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so and then they're sorry</font>

587
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:49,770
and siren has a mixture of all of these

588
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,810
so it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a the goal</font>

589
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,120
anyways to take a lot of the the best of

590
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,540
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know about hypermedia and make a</font>

591
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,670
media type that is suitable api's so

592
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,110
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see actions just as we saw when</font>

593
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,920
we were talking about using<font color="#E5E5E5"> form-based</font>

594
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,900
api's and entities which imply

595
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,870
relationship there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also using</font>

596
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,180
that lick relation that we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

597
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,920
being in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web linking spec and also</font>

598
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,800
makes for navigational purposes of you

599
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,560
know next<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous things like that cool</font>

600
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,080
and who's the author of summer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I</font>

601
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,590
should display that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am I the author</font>

602
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,960
sorry click siren school soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

603
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,460
how do we accept binary data all right

604
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,710
you know this question comes up a lot

605
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,940
maybe I craft group because there's no

606
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,580
one way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no one</font>

607
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,890
way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right and is it seems that</font>

608
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,210
folks only<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do this sometimes but</font>

609
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it it's very</font>

610
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,970
important that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> give ton soon so one</font>

611
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,370
method is to use multi-part form data

612
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly what your browser does</font>

613
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:53,100
when you're filling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a form and you</font>

614
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,770
need to submit a file this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

615
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,610
that looks like there's some

616
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">content-disposition that you put in</font>

617
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,470
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> too to name the field with a value</font>

618
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,830
and you have the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> of assigning</font>

619
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:09,720
different content types to each bit they

620
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,550
sent so the second part there is is a

621
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">JPEG image that's being sent along with</font>

622
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,290
that so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the same thing in</font>

623
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,290
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font>

624
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,630
another option is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in line some</font>

625
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:27,059
base64 encoded version of it so the

626
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,710
downside to that is when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> base 64</font>

627
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,270
encoded it gets a little bit bigger but

628
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,000
at least you can put it in a textual

629
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:36,059
representation right so you can have

630
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,100
your client do that base64 encoding and

631
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,539
then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump this string in there and</font>

632
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,080
submit it up to the server that will

633
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:46,919
decode it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> option is a</font>

634
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:50,549
two-step process it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know creating</font>

635
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,890
a new resource to hold that metadata

636
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:58,470
that you have and then submitting a file

637
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:02,340
that attaches to it and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say no</font>

638
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,690
opt for multi-part form data first there

639
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of tools out there that will</font>

640
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:11,880
help you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a client and that's</font>

641
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:13,860
pretty significant the big thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

642
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,240
was no matter which one you choose and I

643
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,130
think multi-part for me is the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

644
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,020
just be consistent don't have three or

645
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,789
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways in your API to</font>

646
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,970
upload a file it's just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth the</font>

647
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">headache caching caching is another one</font>

648
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those topics that affect i'm really</font>

649
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,419
not talking about everything do with

650
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,490
caching is what are the design

651
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:34,320
implications are not caching is that

652
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:36,240
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so first we'll go</font>

653
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">through different ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

654
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,659
so the three main ways to to do caching

655
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,940
one is exploration so you use a cache

656
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,919
control headers say this is private

657
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,020
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the clients can</font>

658
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,750
cash this no proxy in the middle should

659
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:56,159
be cashing this in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> max age in seconds</font>

660
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:58,110
so this is 30 days I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

661
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">direct message to the client saying hold</font>

662
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:04,289
on to this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

663
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this length of time right another method</font>

664
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:12,179
is etags etags are sometimes calculated

665
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,809
is a checksum of a file or different

666
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,909
data elements that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font>

667
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:21,929
your some databases<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a good like</font>

668
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:24,540
revision number on each document that

669
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:26,919
they have or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

670
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,029
keys for etags much like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

671
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,509
they have like their own key generator

672
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:33,340
service but yeah so when you pull down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

673
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:35,590
resource representation will have any

674
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,450
tag associated with it and if you want

675
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure that you have the latest</font>

676
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,999
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do a gap at that same URL and</font>

677
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,739
include the header if not match<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

678
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:47,350
include any tag that you already that

679
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:50,489
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> received if there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tanks with</font>

680
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:53,289
that then you get the latest response

681
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:57,249
third option is using the last modified

682
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:59,289
header as a hint how fresh the the

683
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:01,509
representation is if you get that's

684
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,249
modified back with your representation

685
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:04,899
the next time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to get it you can</font>

686
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a header in there that says if</font>

687
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:11,080
modified since with that same date and

688
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:12,399
you only get it back if it's newer so

689
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,679
it's a network call but you don't get

690
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:20,830
the full<font color="#E5E5E5"> body of the message back and</font>

691
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,960
you know while there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one particular</font>

692
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,080
caching method to do at all times it

693
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,369
really depends on use cases a common

694
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,659
pitfall that we get into is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

695
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:30,519
don't think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client we think</font>

696
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:32,980
about cashing in terms of saving

697
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,239
resources and saving bandwidth on the

698
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,549
server but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it on</font>

699
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:38,350
the client right a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times that</font>

700
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:40,720
client doesn't need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

701
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,789
network call and you know that saving

702
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,649
that time is very valuable for them so

703
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">just keep that away do we need a</font>

704
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:50,399
JavaScript API so often folks ask we see

705
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,139
this in a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways where the API</font>

706
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,850
and maybe the domain of the system

707
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:57,970
itself has some a lot of complexity

708
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,619
around it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you do an API for say</font>

709
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,119
payment processing and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set</font>

710
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:04,980
payments from credit cards checking

711
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:07,720
accounts paypal google wallet and so on

712
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,070
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> api in order for a developer to</font>

713
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,679
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to use the API and then</font>

714
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">Express how to use it to through the</font>

715
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,980
user interface to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user it can be</font>

716
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:17,169
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

717
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,749
pressure on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API to maybe want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

718
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,159
start giving hints about UI elements or

719
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,389
how to actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and that's</font>

720
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,179
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mistake you want to clean</font>

721
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:27,070
separation between the the API and the

722
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumer however some people think of</font>

723
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,840
this as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDK some people call it an</font>

724
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,090
API the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're so there's so</font>

725
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,309
much understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vsat</font>

726
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,139
a rudimentary level that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

727
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:39,270
presents itself as an anomalous thing

728
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:41,010
like should hey we build

729
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,690
kpi we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of resources</font>

730
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,950
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use those guys to build the</font>

731
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,840
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of the API or should we do</font>

732
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,090
with JavaScript API I'm feeling more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

733
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,770
more that if you're doing an API and you

734
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,240
want a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good adoption and you want</font>

735
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,560
to have an easier job of explaining how

736
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,100
to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to folks you should go ahead</font>

737
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also create a JavaScript library or</font>

738
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,910
JavaScript SDK or API however you want

739
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,320
to call it and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see an</font>

740
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,940
example of spokes who are doing this

741
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well take a look at</font>

742
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,360
LinkedIn the JavaScript API does a great

743
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,740
job of handling all of the

744
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,030
authentication stuff so the developers

745
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have to get down on the weeds on</font>

746
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,080
that and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

747
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,540
library maps on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit the pants of the</font>

748
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,600
core API is really transparent and it

749
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,620
fits really nicely so I do recommend if

750
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,870
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question you were thinking</font>

751
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,940
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and tackle the JavaScript</font>

752
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,940
API now should you do the iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> API an</font>

753
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,960
Android API or SDK yeah maybe but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

754
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know take a look at your priorities</font>

755
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,570
but definitely if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to do one I</font>

756
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,510
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do javascript and take a look at</font>

757
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,360
LinkedIn cool what about posting data so

758
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,850
talk a little bit about actions and you

759
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,140
know submitting changes to state of our

760
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:45,990
representations this is more about let's

761
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how new serialize that data</font>

762
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,370
how and what what form does it take when

763
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,030
we take that request and send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

764
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,130
server one<font color="#CCCCCC"> options to use application</font>

765
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:59,460
xww form URL encoded really long name

766
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:02,490
but is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple it looks just</font>

767
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:07,380
like a query string so some folks said

768
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:09,780
XML as the request body can get kind of

769
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,150
verbose sometimes as XML tends to do but

770
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an option and then there's Jason</font>

771
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,560
right so

772
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,440
we favor the for me well and coated

773
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,800
version it's it's pretty simple it's

774
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,240
easy there are certainly many different

775
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,820
tools out there that folks can use for

776
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is it wrong to use the alternatives</font>

777
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,690
no but definitely favor the simplicity

778
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right how do we handle transactions</font>

779
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,870
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Caddy idea is we're not going to</font>

780
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,160
do a deep dive on transactions we're

781
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,930
just going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets at it and very likely</font>

782
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,090
will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> another web cast just on how to</font>

783
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,440
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> transactions with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an API right</font>

784
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,880
let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at it me safely he's</font>

785
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so handsome in one way you could do</font>

786
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,670
this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can model the transaction</font>

787
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,200
directly in your API right for for this

788
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,830
example we're going to use the concept

789
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,960
of a shopping cart you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have in our</font>

790
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,610
API we have some user they create a

791
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,060
shopping cart with post they get a 201

792
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">created back then you know from the</font>

793
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:12,480
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalog they add you know some</font>

794
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,840
mittens to their their cart let me check

795
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,300
out right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's it's just a matter</font>

796
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,940
of creating that that transaction adding

797
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:24,240
items to it and then doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a commit</font>

798
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,420
right certainly problems can happen you

799
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,890
can get errors back and you know you'll

800
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,950
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we'll talk</font>

801
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:35,400
we'll talk more on that cool so in

802
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">summary we talked about the previous</font>

803
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,420
editions for<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI design we've got a new</font>

804
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,370
book out there and there's a cheat sheet

805
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,540
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of the slide deck I can just</font>

806
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,850
run you through really quickly what our

807
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,390
suggestions are for designing URIs and a

808
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,250
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit on errors and revisions it's</font>

809
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,420
kevin said start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> api modeling it's</font>

810
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,160
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a common language</font>

811
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,100
and a comment understanding among your

812
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,690
API team use OAuth the latest version

813
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">other for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security it's almost always</font>

814
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:03,330
the right one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use and keep in mind</font>

815
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,250
when you're designing your response

816
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,580
messages that the message design is for

817
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,830
developers to parse into those resources

818
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,770
into some objects in their language and

819
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,930
it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to be terse and brief</font>

820
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,520
and let them get to the data as soon as

821
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,660
possible while also including metadata

822
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,120
and notifications and things like that

823
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,740
we give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a quick a quick overview of</font>

824
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's happening in the hypermedia area</font>

825
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,630
with the different specs that are out

826
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,680
there

827
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,600
and as you dig into those you'll see

828
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,650
there's a lot to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn in terms of how</font>

829
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,020
you should think about links and

830
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,730
designing your messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally we</font>

831
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,860
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> touched briefly on transactions</font>

832
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,730
and will do more about that later<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

833
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we'd like to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over to</font>

834
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions and I know there are some</font>

835
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:42,660
piling up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Q&A area here but feel</font>

836
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:45,990
free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start adding some more the first</font>

837
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,070
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Burke Audrey thanks for</font>

838
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,840
writing the question the question is

839
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,060
they making that they may get to this

840
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,100
but we have an exception in quotes which

841
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,630
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> verbal like we have a payment</font>

842
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,220
engine that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> expose and we</font>

843
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,870
can't decide on the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to model</font>

844
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,450
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to store the results</font>

845
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,820
no post or put and get seem strange any

846
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,730
thoughts so yeah we encountered this

847
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,680
pretty often if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are doing things in</font>

848
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,110
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> API and the words that express that</font>

849
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,800
are things like calculate or exchange or

850
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:17,790
convert<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes those are on those</font>

851
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,560
are non resource like API on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its and we</font>

852
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,140
suggest and you can read this in the

853
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,480
e-book we suggest to be very careful to

854
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">use verbs for those types of things and</font>

855
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,320
documents and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of demarcate that the</font>

856
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,820
most part of this API as a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

857
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,990
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it but there are</font>

858
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,870
occasionally things you need to do which

859
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,510
are much more like algorithms and no

860
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,280
David<font color="#E5E5E5"> artifacts created from it so treat</font>

861
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,460
them separately and yeah I like the idea

862
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,110
of using verbs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that just as you</font>

863
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,090
out mine and that's a good general rule

864
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,160
for design right nothing is ever perfect

865
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,670
when you make it exception to the rule

866
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,010
make sure it's documented right cool

867
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michael</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart asks how the links work</font>

868
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,040
with the JSON response this is probably

869
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,760
asked at the point where we'd only shown

870
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,950
XML should we go back and show is that

871
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,130
Dana sirens<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to example that yeah</font>

872
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so there's there's a week at the</font>

873
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,200
bottom there that is just a link to self

874
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:13,080
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really common also the entities</font>

875
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,670
can be seen like links here to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

876
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,930
an owner resource that we're linking to

877
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:22,050
a dog so sorry includes all this in a

878
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,070
renter array all the the rel values are

879
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:27,650
in it right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

880
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:31,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">one some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other formats don't do that but</font>

881
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,460
example here is how how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more of</font>

882
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,730
a key value approach

883
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,120
can only have one rail value for the

884
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:43,410
resource cool thanks again Michael for

885
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,300
asking that question next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

886
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,700
Jason hunt maybe I missed this why would

887
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,650
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this form based API on top of</font>

888
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,890
rest doesn't rest already have a URL and

889
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,350
action yeah so that form based<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is</font>

890
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,930
just communicating which action you

891
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,330
should use to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that and which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

892
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,740
I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make that call and</font>

893
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,290
again the alternatives put all that in

894
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,910
documentation but you lose a little bit

895
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,800
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolvability on that right if your</font>

896
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,030
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start changing if maybe you want</font>

897
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,970
to switch from a patch to a-put for

898
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain architectural reasons you'd have</font>

899
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:15,209
to update<font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation attention to</font>

900
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,620
break your clients putting it right into

901
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message itself allows for that</font>

902
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,580
evolution fantastic and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

903
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">stresses this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you're talking about</font>

904
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,810
doing one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actions it's about that</font>

905
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,830
you're not the current requests and

906
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,300
responses but we are you going to do for

907
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next request and response exactly</font>

908
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I'm moving for cool alright the next</font>

909
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:36,899
question is from lon Miller lon asks so

910
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:41,160
for the meta slide should each URL offer

911
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:44,040
a meta service foo / service / meta food

912
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,689
/ think / minute and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we hinted</font>

913
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,890
at it how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that we should</font>

914
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,170
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about having a dedicated meta</font>

915
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,549
resource so how would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do it</font>

916
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,830
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd have a meta service</font>

917
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:56,640
but that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel right to me and</font>

918
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:59,340
I'd make a meadow resource but only for

919
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,430
those resources that require it again we

920
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,480
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> favor putting that in the message</font>

921
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,760
encapsulated some kind of meta object

922
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,250
and inside the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> one all possible</font>

923
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,970
all right let's question from andreas

924
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:14,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tosh he asks XML vs. Jason isn't JSON</font>

925
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,110
limited / less maintainable for example

00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:37,050
cons all over the place with Jason with

935
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,510
some of these hypermedia formats I've

936
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,700
shown they are extensible if you look at

937
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speck you can add</font>

938
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,550
I think there's a new link relation type

939
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:50,040
called profile I don't know if it is a

940
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-blown standard yet it might be an</font>

941
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,410
internet draft but the profile link

942
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,599
relation will be a way to mix in certain

943
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,570
functionality into an existing JSON API

944
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,220
right now it work with XML time cool my

945
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking that is XML definitely has a much</font>

946
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,099
stronger set of tooling and wisdom and

947
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,099
knowledge that's out there in the world

there's no general rule in HTTP spec

964
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,900
about how you calculate a new tag so

965
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,089
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean use whatever makes sense</font>

966
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,680
cool Jason Kemp asks how our patch

967
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,450
requests handled on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end are you</font>

968
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,160
parsing it into a dynamic sequel string

969
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,990
or what are the best practices around

970
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,619
that we're currently using an ORM and to

971
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:07,319
DMV framework if that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> net well I</font>

972
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,000
mean there are a bunch of pieces to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

973
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:12,349
question here first of all if you're

974
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">putting your you putting your API</font>

975
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:17,490
directly over your data layer there's

976
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">sherman there's a lot you have to think</font>

977
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their would you generate a dynamic</font>

978
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,490
sequel string I don't know that doesn't

979
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too comfortable for me I probably</font>

980
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeling some kind of API model between</font>

981
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:35,339
between that debt service and the

982
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:39,839
back-end data stuff good cool Mike Rossi

983
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:40,859
asks what is your opinion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> odata Kevin</font>

984
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,210
what's your opinion of whole data with

985
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:46,850
my opinion about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think the</font>

986
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,960
OData guys are headed

987
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,450
the direction with where they're going

988
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,110
they're the latest version at least last

989
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,850
I heard I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely close to it I</font>

990
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,680
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've had and they were based on</font>

991
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Adam pub at some point maybe they have</font>

992
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,550
other formats that they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

993
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:07,760
again this is kind of how do we model

994
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:10,220
sequel over our API right they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

995
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,250
get into how you filter results<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

996
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,900
comes like that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

997
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:19,430
cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am comfortable with that</font>

998
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:22,280
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's up cool</font>

999
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,660
question from the vector V in case we

1000
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,430
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the eyes from</font>

1001
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,170
static pages for example HTML and not

1002
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,460
from PHP or other programs i imagine the

1003
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,020
key thing is that the build other

1004
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,240
program front of the server is there any

1005
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,770
way to embed the credentials on your

1006
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">respective of OAuth basic etcetera and</font>

1007
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,900
that make them fall prey to other eyes

1008
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,020
we deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this all the time as we're</font>

1009
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:45,470
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps yeah so just with static</font>

1010
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:49,300
pages how do you protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't</font>

1011
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:52,310
you don't yeah and that's where using we

1012
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,890
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> apogee we have a product a</font>

1013
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:57,320
free product available on FG com that

1014
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:59,330
will allow you to create a proxy and you

1015
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,340
can store some that information in the

1016
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,150
proxy keep it off of the dynamic pages

1017
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:09,680
and do some do some stuff back that way

1018
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:12,140
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty tough overall yeah okay</font>

1019
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,850
next question is from bish how can a

1020
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,380
client requests templates for creating

1021
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,450
new resources and I think that's what

1022
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about the action right</font>

1023
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually see that in siren and in the</font>

1024
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:26,660
collection plus Jason they have right

1025
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:28,460
templates easy enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so user use</font>

1026
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:35,090
dancers use a media type that supports

1027
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:37,400
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright um anis fuck swallow asks how</font>

1028
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:40,640
to facilitate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML transformation of</font>

1029
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,890
JSON response there are a bunch of tools

1030
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help you do that there's open</font>

1031
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,940
source packages at the G has some stuff

1032
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,650
other folks have some stuff to transform

1033
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,750
XML into JSON sometimes it's really

1034
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward in fact the XML the JSON</font>

1035
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,120
is actually often simpler than the other

1036
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,650
way around but

1037
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,000
which was out there don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to find</font>

1038
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:03,280
out google you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with a pudgy if</font>

1039
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,260
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Christopher asks to</font>

1040
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,210
provide minimal security / tracking is

1041
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,070
an access token enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a bunch of</font>

1042
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,900
JavaScript widgets which clients will

1043
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,270
embed into their user interfaces and i'm

1044
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,170
planning on proving each client

1045
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,640
providing i guess each client with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1046
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,280
token the data is not private a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1047
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,310
seems like overkill oooff might be an

1048
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,190
overkill if you're not using user data

1049
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,840
right if your service manages user data

1050
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:29,560
and you have clients that need to access

1051
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,690
that user data Olaf is perfect otherwise

1052
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,800
you know one of the other methods might

1053
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,990
better suit your needs and that's fire

1054
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be ssl-certificates even if</font>

1055
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:40,030
client us is all certificates and basic

1056
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:42,640
off pencil you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh David</font>

1057
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,860
Campbell asks or I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

1058
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,510
influenced can we buy the better word

1059
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,530
for notifications and response I think

1060
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,560
we absolutely could that has way too

1061
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,760
many syllables in it but that's that's

1062
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,680
the one that we liked it seemed to have

1063
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,120
the most relevance for what was going on

1064
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,880
the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real point for putting</font>

1065
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,320
notifications in there as our suggestion

1066
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,060
was just to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have a section</font>

1067
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">for medic made us metadata about the</font>

1068
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,180
response you should have the response

1069
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,950
itself but then keep in mind that there

1070
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,350
are things that are a better happening

1071
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,330
around the app more broadly<font color="#E5E5E5"> or more</font>

1072
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,770
globally that could be interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1073
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,570
store as a separate thing to do so for

1074
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,700
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> app it might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notifications for</font>

1075
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,340
someone else's app it might be alerts or

1076
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,740
info or warnings whatever it is that

1077
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,850
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sorta like the idea the model</font>

1078
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,370
the pattern that we like to be idiot

1079
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,780
piggybacking more generic stuff on top

1080
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,220
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> each response because the app could</font>

1081
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,280
just render it when it gets new data

1082

1084
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">reinbold what are some rules of thumb an</font>

1085
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:40,330
authorization versus authentication

1086
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,070
meaning making sure the client has

1087
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,600
permission to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make requests versus the</font>

1088
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:47,080
user having permissions to modify their

1089
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:51,010
data Oh auth to for both yeah so off

1090
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">tune for both so it ought to whether or</font>

1091
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the client has permission is</font>

1092
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,789
something that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

1093
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,279
manage

1094
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:01,150
your client registration process and

1095
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:05,049
your client policies and since expose

1096
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,640
about versus a user<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay authorization</font>

1097
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:08,559
authentication don't get it was that

1098
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,809

1100
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:16,089
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm up to seven now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one document</font>

1101
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right our last question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for today</font>

1102
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,739
from Peter how many items would you

1103
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,380
limit a JSON response to in the case

1104
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that each object has 10,000 cute I'm</font>

1105
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,609
sorry that HIV has<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 key value pairs I</font>

1106
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,809
use something like sending 300 merchants

1107
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:31,119
location to the client on one response

1108
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:32,410
to too big / network heavy in the

1109
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,199
previous version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this we talked about</font>

1110
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:38,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a rule of thumb around 10 we have</font>

1111
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:41,049
you know we have 10 fingers we have a

1112
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:43,359
mostly decimal based<font color="#CCCCCC"> calming system all</font>

1113
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:45,819
over the world so I think using a using

1114
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,199
10<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your default makes sense if your</font>

1115
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:48,279
data is really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big make it</font>

1116
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,169
smaller than 10 de this really really

1117
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">small make it bigger than 10 but I think</font>

1118
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:56,529
started with 10 is a good rule of thumb

1119
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:58,359
and test this out to right I mean have

1120
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:59,769
clients out there that you're testing

1121
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:01,029
with and if you know you're gonna have a

1122
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:02,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of mobile clients see how this</font>

1123
00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:04,689
feels on a mobile client if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1124
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:06,729
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a bunch of you know</font>

1125
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:08,259
back-end systems that our clients test
